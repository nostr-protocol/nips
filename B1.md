Tiny Notes
----------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines `kind:25` as a simple plaintext note that is limited to 140 **visible** characters.

The `.content` property contains some human-readable text. 

Clients MUST force outgoing `.content` to be less or equal to 140 characters and crop all incoming events to the same amount.

Markup languages such as markdown MUST NOT be used.

Replies to `kind:25` MUST use [NIP-22](22.md) comments while applying the same content rules as defined here.

Reactions MUST use [NIP-25](25.md) with a `k` tag to `25`. Clients MUST only download and display reactions that include the `k` tag in notifications.

Zap Events MUST also include the `k` tag of the source event. Clients MUST only render zaps that include the `k` tag in notifications.

## Cached Information

Tiny notes strongly rely on in-event caches to speed up the rendering process and calculate the 140-char limit. 

User citations MUST use a variation of [NIP-19](NIP-19)'s `nostr:nprofile` urls with a `4`th TLV type that receives the current name of the user. The user's display name MUST be used to match the 140 limit. `p` tags SHOULD only be added if the logged-in user wants to notify the tagged user.

Quoted notes that are `kind:25` MUST use [NIP-19](NIP-19)'s `nostr:nevent` or `nostr:naddr` with a `4`th TLV type including the quoted text. The quoted text MUST be used to match the 140 limit. The `q` tag MUST be added to all quoted events. 

Quoted notes that are not `kind:25` MUST not be previewed or rendered by the client. Instead, the Client must render the quoted text from the TLV as a link. The link should open a separate app that can render those events using [NIP-89](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/89.md). The `q` tag MUST be used.

Links to images MUST include [NIP-92](92.md) `imeta` tags with required fields: `url`, `m`, `blurhash`, `dim`, and `x` and should be previewed in full-width mode

Links to websites MUST include [PR1674](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/1674) open graph tags and should be previewed in full-width mode
