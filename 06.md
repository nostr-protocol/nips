Basic key derivation from mnemonic seed phrase
----------------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:fiatjaf`

[BIP39](https://bips.xyz/39) is used to generate mnemonic seed words and derive a binary seed from them.

[BIP32](https://bips.xyz/32) is used to derive the path `m/44'/1237'/<account>'/0/0` (according to the Nostr entry on [SLIP44](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md)).

A basic client can simply use an `account` of `0` to derive a single key. For more advanced use-cases you can increment `account`, allowing generation of practically infinite keys from the 5-level path with hardened derivation.

Other types of clients can still get fancy and use other derivation paths for their own other purposes.
