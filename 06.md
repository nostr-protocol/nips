Basic key derivation from mnemonic seed phrase
----------------------------------------------

`draft` `optional`

[BIP39](https://bips.xyz/39) is used to generate mnemonic seed words and derive a binary seed from them.

[BIP32](https://bips.xyz/32) is used to derive the path `m/44'/1237'/<account>'/0/0` (according to the Nostr entry on [SLIP44](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md)).

A basic client can simply use an `account` of `0` to derive a single key. For more advanced use-cases you can increment `account`, allowing generation of practically infinite keys from the 5-level path with hardened derivation.

Other types of clients can still get fancy and use other derivation paths for their own other purposes.

### Multi account management

An implementation possibility for clients and signers is to support multi account management based on one key/seed phrases. They can use a single key for user as master key and generate child keys on-demand for multi account management. by changing the client or signer all accounts can retrieved by master key. specific `account` number can be provided by user as well.

One use case it managing related account from one person or team with one key. For example main account, bot account (automated), news and updated and more.
