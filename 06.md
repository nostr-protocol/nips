Basic key derivation from mnemonic seed phrase
----------------------------------------------

`draft` `optional`

[BIP39](https://bips.xyz/39) is used to generate mnemonic seed words and derive a binary seed from them.

[BIP32](https://bips.xyz/32) is used to derive the path `m/44'/1237'/<account>'/0/0` (according to the Nostr entry on [SLIP44](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md)).

A basic client can simply use an `account` of `0` to derive a single key. For more advanced use-cases you can increment `account`, allowing the generation of practically infinite keys from the 5-level path with hardened derivation.

Other types of clients may choose to get fancy and use other derivation paths for their own alternative purposes.

Because Nostr uses [Schnorr signatures standard for the curve `secp256k1`](https://bips.xyz/340), public keys have extra compression compared to Bitcoin ECDSA compressed public keys, meaning that the y-coordinate is not only omitted, but parity is not even indicated with the '03'(odd), nor '02' (even) prefixes. In other words, only the x-coordinate is included without any extra prefix marker. This matters in three contexts (there may be others):
 - When borrowing code from Bitcoin public/private key ECDSA cryptography. This will output 33-byte public keys with a 02/03 prefix (compressed) or 04 (uncompressed). The first byte (prefix) needs to be removed.
 - Conversion of a public key, to bech32. The pure x-coordinate value without prefix must be used as the input, not a compressed public key.
