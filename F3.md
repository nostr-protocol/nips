Scrobbling
----------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines `kind:1073` as a _scrobble_ event. It has the following format:

```yaml
{
  "kind": 1073,
  "tags": [
    ["i", "isrc:<code>"],
    ["title", "<song title>"],
    ["album", "<song album>", "<optional variant>"],
    ["artist", "<musician or band>", "<optional variant>"]
  ]
  // other fields...
}
```

### Metadata

`"title"`, `"album"` and `"artist"` should always be included, but in case the ISRC code is also included (as it should unless it's too impossible) ISRC can be seen as the authoritative source for all metadata related to the given song, the other tags being just hints.

### Relays

Scrobbles should be published to the author's "write" relays (as per [NIP-65](65.md)).

### Usage

Given that Nostr is open it makes no sense to speak of a _global_ "most listened" tracks, for example, as _last.fm_ does.

It does make sense, however, for clients to display the "most listened" and other stats in the context of individual relays or groups of relays, as long as such relays are gated to a certain community or trusted to not have sybils or spam.

It also makes sense to display data such as "most listened by your friends", "most listened by friends of friends" and other arbitrary selections.

The same is true for things like a feed of "recently listened" tracks.

#### Commenting on tracks

It makes sense to comment on a track by using a [NIP-22](22.md) with a `"i"` tag containing its ISRC code, as specified in [NIP-73](73.md). That way it's possible to display comments in context with scrobbles on a track page, for example, and whatever else.

#### Correcting History

It shouldn't be hard to "edit" an old scrobble by simply deleting it and creating a new scrobble.
