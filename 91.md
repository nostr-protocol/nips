Routstr Provider Discoverability
--------------------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP describes `kind:38000`, `kind:38421`: a way to discover Routstr AI proxy providers, their capabilities, and people who recommend them.

## Rationale

Routstr provides a way to access AI models through Nostr, offering privacy-preserving access to various language models. This NIP provides a standardized way for users to discover Routstr providers, their supported models, and receive recommendations from other users.

### Parties involved

There are three actors to this workflow:

* A Routstr provider operator, announces their service and its capabilities.
  * Publishes `kind:38421`, detailing how to connect to it and its capabilities.
* user A, who recommends a Routstr provider
  * Publishes `kind:38000` with `k` tag set to `38421`
* user B, who seeks a recommendation for a Routstr provider
  * Queries for `kind:38000` with `#k` filter for `38421`, and based on results, queries for `kind:38421`

## Events

### Recommendation event

The recommendation event uses `kind:38000` as defined in [NIP-87](87.md), which is a general-purpose service recommendation event. Different services are distinguished by the `k` tag.

```json
{
  "kind": 38000,
  "pubkey": <recommender-user-pubkey>,
  "tags": [
    ["k", "38421"],
    ["d", "<d-identifier>"],
    ["u", <recommended-routstr-http-url>],
    ["a", "38421:routstr-provider-pubkey:<d-identifier>", "wss://relay1"]
  ],
  "content": "Fast and reliable AI proxy with great model selection"
}
```

The recommendation event is a parameterized-replaceable event so that a user can change/edit their recommendation without creating a new event.

The `d` tag in `kind:38000` is the `kind:38421` event identifier this event is recommending.
The `k` tag is the kind number that corresponds to the event kind that the user is recommending, in this case `kind:38421` for Routstr providers.

Optional `u` tags can be added to give a recommended way to connect to the provider.
The value of the tag is the HTTP URL of the Routstr provider.
Multiple `u` tags can appear on the same `kind:38000` (for example, clearnet and onion URLs).

`a` tags are used to point to the `kind:38421` event of the Routstr provider.
The first value of the tag is the `kind:38421` event identifier, the second value of the tag is a relay hint.

The content can be used to give a review or description.

## Routstr Provider Information

Routstr providers SHOULD publish `kind:38421` events to announce their capabilities and how to connect to them.

The `d` tag SHOULD be a unique identifier for the provider instance (e.g., domain name or unique ID).

```json
{
  "kind": 38421,
  "pubkey": "<routstr-provider-pubkey>",
  "content": "<optional-kind:0-style-metadata>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<unique-provider-identifier>"],
    ["u", "https://api.routstr.com/"],
    ["u", "fhxpl22punqhmmgcldhbusmxrmxa36gx2hbrr7yz4trq5wwthwbxucqd.onion"],
    ["models", "gpt-4o-mini,gpt-4o,claude-3-5-sonnet,claude-3-5-haiku,mistral-large,llama-3.3-70b"],
    ["mint", "https://mint.example.com"],
    ["version", "0.0.1"]
  ]
}
```

### Tags

* `d` - Unique identifier for the provider instance
* `u` - URLs to connect to the Routstr provider (HTTP endpoints)
* `models` - Comma-separated list of supported AI models
* `mint` - (Optional) Associated ecash mint for payments
* `version` - Provider software version
* `content` is an optional `metadata`-like stringified JSON object, as described in NIP-01. This content is useful when the pubkey creating the `kind:38421` is not a normal user. If `content` is empty, the `kind:0` of the pubkey should be used to display provider information (e.g. name, picture, web, LUD16, etc.)

### Model Capabilities

Providers MAY include additional tags to describe model-specific capabilities:

```json
{
  "tags": [
    ["model-cap", "gpt-4o", "max_tokens:128000,vision:true,tools:true"],
    ["model-cap", "claude-3-5-sonnet", "max_tokens:200000,vision:true,tools:true"],
    ["model-cap", "llama-3.3-70b", "max_tokens:32768,vision:false,tools:true"]
  ]
}
```

## Example

### User A recommends a Routstr provider

User A might be a user of a Routstr provider. Using a client, user A publishes an event recommending the provider they use.

```json
{
  "kind": 38000,
  "tags": [
    ["k", "38421"],
    ["d", "api.routstr.com"],
    ["u", "https://api.routstr.com/"],
    ["u", "fhxpl22punqhmmgcldhbusmxrmxa36gx2hbrr7yz4trq5wwthwbxucqd.onion"],
    ["a", "38421:routstr-provider-pubkey:api.routstr.com", "wss://relay1"]
  ],
  "content": "Routstr proxy - reliable and fast with good model selection"
}
```

### User B finds a Routstr provider

User B wants to use AI models through Nostr, they need to find a Routstr provider.

User B's client queries for `kind:38000` events, looking for recommendations for Routstr providers.

```json
["REQ", <id>, [{ "kinds": [38000], "authors": [<user>, <users-contact-list>], "#k": ["38421"] }]]
```

User B, who follows User A, sees that `kind:38000` event and queries for the provider information:

```json
["REQ", <id>, [{ "kinds": [38421], "#d": ["api.routstr.com"] }]]
```

The client then connects to the recommended Routstr provider using the URLs provided.

### Alternative query bypassing `kind:38000`

Alternatively, users might choose to query directly for `kind:38421` events. Clients SHOULD be careful doing this and use spam-prevention mechanisms or query high-quality restricted relays to avoid directing users to malicious providers.

```json
["REQ", <id>, [{ "kinds": [38421] }]]
```
