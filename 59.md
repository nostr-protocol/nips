NIP-59
======

Gift Wrap
---------

`optional`

This NIP defines event kinds and procedures for encapsulating other nostr events with variying degrees of privacy. The goal is to provide tools to obscure the right amount of metadata for separate use cases.

This NIP *does not* define any messaging protocol. Applications of this NIP should be defined separately.

This NIP relies on [NIP-44](./44.md)'s versioned encryption algorithms.

# Overview

This NIP uses three main primitives to protect the metadata of an event: `rumor`s, `seal`s, and `gift wrap`s.

- A `rumor` is any unsigned nostr event. If it is leaked, it cannot be verified.
- A `seal` signs the encrypted rumor in it's `.content`, making the rumor verifiable without revealing it. 
- A `gift wrap` encrypts any other signed event using random private keys to a known destination in its `tags`.  

The rumor carries the content itself but if it leaks it will be rejected by relays and clients and can't be authenticated. This provides a measure of deniability.

The `seal` exposes the signer, but not the contents or the receiver. The `gift wrap` exposes the receiver, or an alias to the receiver, but not the signer. 

The 3 primitives can be used together or separatedly depending on the application. 

## The Seal Event Kind

A `seal` is a `kind:13` event that wraps a `rumor` and is signed with the sender's regular private key. The `seal` is **always** encrypted to a receiver's pubkey but there is no `p` tag to expose who can decrypt it. There is no way to know who the rumor is for without the receiver's or the sender's private key. The only public information in this event is who is signing it.

```js
{
  "id": "<id>",
  "pubkey": "<real author's pubkey>",
  "created_at": now() or randomTimeUpTo2DaysInThePast(),
  "kind": 13,
  "tags": [],
  "content": nip44Encrypt(rumor, "<recipient pubkey>", "<author's private key>"),
  "sig": "<real author's pubkey signature>"
}
```

`.content` contains the cyphertext of the [NIP-44](44.md) encryption of the JSON-encoded rumor. 

Tags MUST must always be empty. 

The inner event MUST always be unsigned.

To increase privacy, `.created_at` MAY not be accurate. 

## The Gift Wrap Event Kind

A `gift wrap` event is a `kind:1059` event that wraps any other event. `tags` SHOULD include any information needed to route the inner event to its intended recipient, including the recipient's `p` tag or [NIP-13](13.md) proof of work.

```js
{
  "id": "<id>",
  "pubkey": "<random, one-time-use pubkey>",
  "created_at": now() or randomTimeUpTo2DaysInThePast(),
  "kind": 1059,
  "tags": [["p", "<recipient pubkey>", "<relay>"]],
  "content": nip44Encrypt(event, "<recipient pubkey>", "<random private key>"),
  "sig": "<random, one-time-use pubkey signature>"
}
```

`.content` contains the cyphertext of the [NIP-44](44.md) encryption of the JSON-encoded event. 

To increase privacy, `.created_at` MAY not be accurate. 

Relays SHOULD only serve `kind 1059` events intended for the marked recipient based on user AUTH. 

Clients SHOULD only send wrapped events to destination relays that offer this protection.

Relays MAY choose not to store Gift-wrapped events due to them not being publicly useful. Clients MAY choose
to attach a certain amount of proof-of-work to the wrapper event per [NIP-13](13.md) in a bid to demonstrate that
the event is not spam or a denial-of-service attack.

# Most Private Protocol

In cases of elevated privacy needs, the 3 primitives can be used together, one after another. In this scheme, even if all of the decrypted payloads leak, the sender and receiver are not publicly connected in a verifiable event and none of the inner event's information can be publicly verified.

To transfer an event from pubkey A to pubkey B, perform the following steps:   
1. Turn an event into a Rumor by deleting the signature. 
2. Seal the Rumor 
3. Gift Wrap the Seal 
4. Send the Gift Wrap to the relays of the receiver.

In pseudo-code:

```js
{
  "id": "<id>",
  "pubkey": "<random-pubkey>",
  "created_at": randomTimeUpTo2DaysInThePast()
  "kind": 1059,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<pubkey-B>"],
  ],
  "content": nip44Encrypt({
    "id": "<id>",
    "pubkey" "<pubkey-A>",
    "created_at": "created_at": randomTimeUpTo2DaysInThePast()
    "kind": 13, // seal
    "tags": [],
    "content": nip44Encrypt(rumor, pubkeyB, privkeyA),
    "sig": "<signed by pubkey-A>"
  }, pubkeyB, privkeyRandom)
  "sig": "<random, one-time-use pubkey signature>"
}
```

If the `rumor` is intended for more than one party, or if the author wants to retain an encrypted copy, a single `rumor` may be sealed, wrapped and addressed for each recipient and the author individually.

The canonical `created_at` time belongs to the `rumor`. All other timestamps SHOULD be tweaked to thwart time-analysis attacks. Note that some relays don't serve events dated in the future, so all timestamps SHOULD be in the past.

# Gift Wrap as an onion routing payload

Gift wraps can be used separetedly to hide any signed event from the public and routing relays/servers. 

For instance, to send an event through a push notification stack without the stack knowing about the event or who is it for, simply wrap it on a `kind 1059` event. Since the stack already has a token, the `p` tag to the receiver (which would reveal who the receiver is) is not needed.  

```js
{
  "id": "<id>",
  "pubkey": "<random-pubkey>",
  "created_at": randomTimeUpTo2DaysInThePast()
  "kind": 1059,
  "tags": [
    ["token", "<destination push notification token>"],
  ],
  "content": nip44Encrypt(notificationEvent, pubkeyB, privkeyRandom)
  "sig": "<random, one-time-use pubkey signature>"
}
```

# A Walkthrough Example

Let's send a private `kind 1` note between two parties asking "Are you going to the party tonight?"

- Sender private key: `0beebd062ec8735f4243466049d7747ef5d6594ee838de147f8aab842b15e273`
- Recipient private key: `e108399bd8424357a710b606ae0c13166d853d327e47a6e5e038197346bdbf45`
- Ephemeral wrapper key: `4f02eac59266002db5801adc5270700ca69d5b8f761d8732fab2fbf233c90cbd`

## 1. Create a rumor

Create a `kind 1` event with the message, the receivers, and any other tags you want. 

Do not sign the event.

```json
{
  "id": "9dd003c6d3b73b74a85a9ab099469ce251653a7af76f523671ab828acd2a0ef9", 
  "pubkey": "611df01bfcf85c26ae65453b772d8f1dfd25c264621c0277e1fc1518686faef9",
  "created_at": 1691518405,
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [],
  "content": "Are you going to the party tonight?",
  "sig": ""
}
```

## 2. Seal the rumor

Encrypt the JSON-encoded `rumor` with a conversation key derived using the sender's private key and the recipient's public key. Place the result in the `.content` field of a `kind 13` `seal` event. Sign it with the sender's key.

```json
{
  "id": "28a87d7c074d94a58e9e89bb3e9e4e813e2189f285d797b1c56069d36f59eaa7",
  "pubkey": "611df01bfcf85c26ae65453b772d8f1dfd25c264621c0277e1fc1518686faef9",
  "created_at": 1703015180,
  "kind": 13,
  "tags": [],
  "content": "AqBCdwoS7/tPK+QGkPCadJTn8FxGkd24iApo3BR9/M0uw6n4RFAFSPAKKMgkzVMoRyR3ZS/aqATDFvoZJOkE9cPG/TAzmyZvr/WUIS8kLmuI1dCA+itFF6+ULZqbkWS0YcVU0j6UDvMBvVlGTzHz+UHzWYJLUq2LnlynJtFap5k8560+tBGtxi9Gx2NIycKgbOUv0gEqhfVzAwvg1IhTltfSwOeZXvDvd40rozONRxwq8hjKy+4DbfrO0iRtlT7G/eVEO9aJJnqagomFSkqCscttf/o6VeT2+A9JhcSxLmjcKFG3FEK3Try/WkarJa1jM3lMRQqVOZrzHAaLFW/5sXano6DqqC5ERD6CcVVsrny0tYN4iHHB8BHJ9zvjff0NjLGG/v5Wsy31+BwZA8cUlfAZ0f5EYRo9/vKSd8TV0wRb9DQ=",

}
```

## 3. Wrap the seal

Encrypt the JSON-encoded `kind 13` event with your ephemeral, single-use random key. Place the result in the `content` field of a `kind 1059`. Add a single `p` tag containing the recipient's public key. Sign the `gift wrap` using the random key generated in the previous step.

```json
{
  "id": "5c005f3ccf01950aa8d131203248544fb1e41a0d698e846bd419cec3890903ac",

  "created_at": 1703021488,
  "kind": 1059,
  "tags": [["p", "166bf3765ebd1fc55decfe395beff2ea3b2a4e0a8946e7eb578512b555737c99"]],

}
```

## 4. Broadcast Selectively

Broadcast the `kind 1059` event to the recipient's relays only. Delete all the other events.

# Code Samples

## JavaScript

```javascript
import {bytesToHex} from "@noble/hashes/utils"
import type {EventTemplate, UnsignedEvent, Event} from "nostr-tools"
import {getPublicKey, getEventHash, nip19, nip44, finalizeEvent, generateSecretKey} from "nostr-tools"

type Rumor = UnsignedEvent & {id: string}

const TWO_DAYS = 2 * 24 * 60 * 60

const now = () => Math.round(Date.now() / 1000)
const randomNow = () => Math.round(now() - (Math.random() * TWO_DAYS))

const nip44ConversationKey = (privateKey: Uint8Array, publicKey: string) =>
  nip44.v2.utils.getConversationKey(bytesToHex(privateKey), publicKey)

const nip44Encrypt = (data: EventTemplate, privateKey: Uint8Array, publicKey: string) =>
  nip44.v2.encrypt(JSON.stringify(data), nip44ConversationKey(privateKey, publicKey))

const nip44Decrypt = (data: Event, privateKey: Uint8Array) =>
  JSON.parse(nip44.v2.decrypt(data.content, nip44ConversationKey(privateKey, data.pubkey)))

const createRumor = (event: Partial<UnsignedEvent>, privateKey: Uint8Array) => {
  const rumor = {
    created_at: now(),
    content: "",
    tags: [],
    ...event,
    pubkey: getPublicKey(privateKey),
  } as any

  rumor.id = getEventHash(rumor)

  return rumor as Rumor
}

const createSeal = (rumor: Rumor, privateKey: Uint8Array, recipientPublicKey: string) => {
  return finalizeEvent(
    {
      kind: 13,
      content: nip44Encrypt(rumor, privateKey, recipientPublicKey),
      created_at: randomNow(),
      tags: [],
    },
    privateKey
  ) as Event
}

const createWrap = (event: Event, recipientPublicKey: string) => {
  const randomKey = generateSecretKey()

  return finalizeEvent(
    {
      kind: 1059,
      content: nip44Encrypt(event, randomKey, recipientPublicKey),
      created_at: randomNow(),
      tags: [["p", recipientPublicKey]],
    },
    randomKey
  ) as Event
}

// Test case using the above example
const senderPrivateKey = nip19.decode(`nsec1p0ht6p3wepe47sjrgesyn4m50m6avk2waqudu9rl324cg2c4ufesyp6rdg`).data
const recipientPrivateKey = nip19.decode(`nsec1uyyrnx7cgfp40fcskcr2urqnzekc20fj0er6de0q8qvhx34ahazsvs9p36`).data
const recipientPublicKey = getPublicKey(recipientPrivateKey)

const rumor = createRumor(
  {
    kind: 1,
    content: "Are you going to the party tonight?",
  },
  senderPrivateKey
)

const seal = createSeal(rumor, senderPrivateKey, recipientPublicKey)
const wrap = createWrap(seal, recipientPublicKey)

// Recipient unwraps with his/her private key.

const unwrappedSeal = nip44Decrypt(wrap, recipientPrivateKey)
const unsealedRumor = nip44Decrypt(unwrappedSeal, recipientPrivateKey)
```
