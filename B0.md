Web Bookmarking
---------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines `kind:39701` for a URI as editable web bookmark which uses the HTTP scheme.

### Format

The format uses `kind:39701`.

The `.content` should be a detailed description of the web bookmark. It can be an empty string.

The `d` tag is just their URL without the scheme, which is always and everywhere assumed to be `https://` or `http://`.

In this way web bookmarks events can be queried by the `d` tag by clients.

### Metadata

Metadata fields can be added as tags to the event as necessary.

* `"t"`, for "tags"/"hashtags" (i.e. topics about which the event might be of relevance)
* `"published_at"`, for the timestamp in unix seconds (stringified) of the first time the bookmark was published
* `"title"`, title about bookmark and can be used as a attribute for the HTML link element
