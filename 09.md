Event Deletion
--------------

`draft` `optional`

Event kind `5` describes a deletion event. It MUST contain a list of one or more `e` or `a` tags, each referencing the events the author is requesting to be deleted.

The `.content` MAY contain the reason for the deletion. One or more `k` tags MAY be added to describe the kind of the referenced events. 

```
{
  "kind": 5,
  "pubkey": <32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "tags": [
    ["e", "dcd59..464a2"],
    ["e", "968c5..ad7a4"],
    ["k", "<kind>"],
    ["a", "<kind>:<pubkey>:<d-identifier>"]
  ],
  "content": "these posts were published by accident",
  ...other fields
}
```

Supporters MUST verify if the `pubkey` of the Deletion event is the same as the `pubkey` of the referenced events.

Deletion events referencing an `a` tag delete all the referenced events up Deletion event's `created_at`. 

Relays SHOULD delete or stop publishing any referenced events of the deletion request. 

Relays SHOULD continue to publish/share the deletion events indefinitely, as clients may already have the event that's intended to be deleted. 

Clients SHOULD hide or otherwise indicate a deleted status for referenced events.

Clients SHOULD broadcast deletion events to other relays which don't have it.

## Deleting a Deletion

Publishing a deletion event against a deletion has no effect.
