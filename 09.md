Event Deletion Request
----------------------

`draft` `optional`

A special event with kind `5`, meaning "deletion request" is defined as having a list of one or more `e` or `a` tags, each referencing an event the author requests to be deleted. Deletion requests SHOULD include a `k` tag for the kind of each event being requested for deletion.

The event's `content` field MAY contain a text note describing the reason for the deletion request.

For example:

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 5,
  "pubkey": <32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "tags": [
    ["e", "dcd59..464a2"],
    ["e", "968c5..ad7a4"],
    ["a", "<kind>:<pubkey>:<d-identifier>"],
    ["k", "1"],
    ["k", "30023"]
  ],
  "content": "these posts were published by accident",
  // other fields...
}
```

Relays SHOULD delete or stop publishing any referenced events with an identical `pubkey` to the deletion request.  Clients SHOULD hide or otherwise indicate a deletion request status for referenced events.

Relays SHOULD continue to publish/share the deletion request events indefinitely, as clients may already have the event that's intended to be deleted. Additionally, clients SHOULD broadcast deletion request events to other relays that don't have it.

When an `a` tag is used, relays SHOULD delete all versions of the replaceable event up to the `created_at` timestamp of the deletion request event.

## Filter Deletion

A client MAY use a `filter` tag to provide a filter, relays and clients SHOULD consider deletation of all events matching to this specific filter from this client up to `kind 5` created at.

For example:
```jsonc
{
  "kind": 5,
  "pubkey": <32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "tags": [
    ["filter", "{\"kinds\":[1,7]}"]
  ],
  "content": "no more text notes and reactions.",
  // other fields...
}
```

The above event requests the deletion of all text notes and reactions from a user.

A kind 5 MUST NOT contain a `filter` tag beside other tags, or multiple `filter` tags in one event. The `"authors"` field of the filter should be implicit. relays and clients must consider filter `since` and `until` fields to find events to be deleted in case of the time range, not the deletion event `created_at`.

### Usages

User can make complex bulk deletation requests with consuming small space and this bring possiblited to remove ***all posts***, ***direct messages***, or ***delete account***.

## Client Usage

Clients MAY choose to fully hide any events that are referenced by valid deletion request events.  This includes text notes, direct messages, or other yet-to-be defined event kinds.  Alternatively, they MAY show the event along with an icon or other indication that the author has "disowned" the event.  The `content` field MAY also be used to replace the deleted events' content, although a user interface should indicate that this is a deletion request reason, not the original content.

A client MUST validate that each event `pubkey` referenced in the `e` tag of the deletion request is identical to the deletion request `pubkey`, before hiding or deleting any event.  Relays can not, in general, perform this validation and should not be treated as authoritative.

Clients display the deletion request event itself in any way they choose, e.g., not at all, or with a prominent notice.

Clients MAY inform the user that their request for deletion does not guarantee deletion because it is impossible to delete events from all relays and clients.

## Relay Usage

Relays MAY validate that a deletion request event only references events that have the same `pubkey` as the deletion request itself, however, this is not required since relays may not have knowledge of all referenced events.

## Deletion Request of a Deletion Request

Publishing a deletion request event against a deletion request has no effect.  Clients and relays are not obliged to support "unrequest deletion" functionality.

## Protection for a Deletion Request

if the deletion request is intended to be applied in a set of limited relays, clients can send them as protected events and expect other relays to not execute them in sync or broadcasting.
