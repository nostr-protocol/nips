Encrypted Group Chat
--------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:vishalxl` 

This NIP defines new event kinds for encrypted group chat. 

It works by creating a shared secret that is used to encrypt the group or channel messages. Only the participants know that secret, so only such members can read/write to this group chat.

It reserves three event kinds (140-142) for immediate use and 7 event kinds (143-149) for future use.

- `140 - create encrypted channel`
- `141 - change channel metadata including participants`
- `142 - send encrypted message`


## Kind 140: Create Encrypted channel

Create a Encrypted chat channel.

In the channel creation `content` field, Client SHOULD include basic channel metadata (`name`, `about`, `picture` as specified in kind 41).

```json
{
    "content": "{\"name\": \"Demo Channel\", \"about\": \"A test channel.\", \"picture\": \"https://placekitten.com/200/200\"}",
    ...
}
```

The members of the group ( people who are allowed to post there) should be added as p tags to this event.

Further, the creator of the channel should send a Direct Message to each of the other participants, which will have the channel's shared-secret private/public keys. The Direct message should be sent by a kind other than 4; but presently kind 4 direct messages are used. 

The format of that message is:

`App Encrypted Channels: inviting you to encrypted channel <channel id> encrypted using private public keys <shared private key> <corresponding shared public key>`

The three id's mentioned should each be 64 byte long hex encoded strings. No quotes are used.

Clients that support this NIP will read that and know that they're invited to join the given encrypted channel, and they can use the given secret key to send/read messages in that channel.
Other clients will decrypt this message, and ignore it, but the user can read that they have been invited to such a channel.

## Kind 141: Set Encrypted channel metadata

Update an encrypted channel's public metadata including its particpants.

Clients and relays SHOULD handle kind 141 events similar to kind 0 `metadata` events.

Clients SHOULD ignore kind 141s from pubkeys other than the kind 140 pubkey.

Clients SHOULD support basic metadata fields:

- `name` - string - Channel name
- `about` - string - Channel description
- `picture` - string - URL of channel picture

Clients MAY add additional metadata fields.

Clients SHOULD use [NIP-10](10.md) marked "e" tags to recommend a relay.

```json
{
    "content": "{\"name\": \"Updated Demo Channel\", \"about\": \"Updating a test channel.\", \"picture\": \"https://placekitten.com/201/201\"}",
    "tags": [["e", <channel_create_event_id> <relay-url>]],
    ...
}
```


## Kind 142: Create encrypted channel message

Send a text message to an encrypted channel.

Clients SHOULD use [NIP-10](10.md) marked "e" tags to recommend a relay and specify whether it is a reply or root message.

Clients SHOULD append [NIP-10](10.md) "p" tags to replies.

### Format

Root message:

```json
{
    "content": <string>,
    "tags": [["e", <kind_40_event_id> <relay-url> "root"]],
    ...
}
```

Reply to another message:

```json
{
    "content": <string>,
    "tags": [
        ["e", <kind_42_event_id> <relay-url> "reply"],
        ["p", <pubkey> <relay-url>],
        ...
    ],
    ...
}
```

### Encryption

All participants should ideally have the shared secret sent to them by the creator of the channel. If such a message is present, the client should get the shared secret from that messages, and then encrypt the 142 kind message using that.

Only the given shared-secret private and public keys are used to encrypt or decrypt the messages. 


## NIP-10 relay recommendations

For [NIP-10](10.md) relay recommendations, clients generally SHOULD use the relay URL of the original (oldest) kind 40 event.

Clients MAY recommend any relay URL. For example, if a relay hosting the original kind 40 event for a channel goes offline, clients could instead fetch channel data from a backup relay, or a relay that clients trust more than the original relay.


Future extensibility
--------------------

We reserve event kinds 143-149 for other events related to chat, to potentially include new types of media (photo/video), moderation, etc.


Motivation
----------
This is one step to make some private channels. 

Drawbacks
---------
The meta-data for any message is practically much public in nostr. So such group chat should not be considered private. Anybody can see who is sending message(s) to what channel, and when.

Further, if any single participant of the group chat leaks the shared secret ( whether intentionally or by accident), all the messages (past or future) can then be decrypted by others.
