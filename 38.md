User Statuses
-------------

`draft` `optional`

## Abstract

This NIP enables a way for users to share live statuses such as what music they are listening to, as well as what they are currently doing: work, play, out of office, etc.

## Live Statuses

A special event with `kind:30315` "User Status" is defined as an *optionally expiring* _addressable event_, where the `d` tag represents the status type.


### Live Statuses Types

Here is the list of standard status types:

#### General

The `general` represent general statuses: "Working", "Hiking", etc. Example:

```json
{
  "kind": 30315,
  "content": "Sign up for nostrasia!",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "general"],
    ["r", "https://nostr.world"]
  ],
}
```

#### Music

The `music` status events are for live streaming what you are currently listening to. The expiry of the `music` status should be when the track will stop playing. Example:

```json
{
  "kind": 30315,
  "content": "Intergalatic - Beastie Boys",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "music"],
    ["r", "spotify:search:Intergalatic%20-%20Beastie%20Boys"],
    ["expiration", "1692845589"]
  ],
}
```

#### Story

The `story-N` status events are a list of statuses chained together and they can contain media as well. The N part is a number which makes stories different in d tag. The clients MAY used them to show the index of story as well.

A event with kind `10010` will bea story set which shows a list of current user stories:

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 10010,
  "tags": [
    ["e", "5281b3a7b21456523b0fc9bebf33cc0dc433efb8fe90ea903824d70bc15165c6"],
    ["e", "adba7a507146c8aaf2733487443dfeb37c8c46df2ce696bf3a858744106b1a2e"],
    ["e", "6ccd337c6a3360a09acc8c49448597148e726f3dd6d3b62d5ddb3c9362d56f18"]
    // more e tags....
  ],
}
```

The client SHOULD update this list when request for an event to be created or deleted. order of stories MUST be same as their position on tags array.

Each story event looks like this:

```json
{
  "kind": 30315,
  "content": "Enjoy the trip in nostr city!",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "story-N"],
    ["p", "bd4ae3e67e29964d494172261dc45395c89f6bd2e774642e366127171dfb81f5"],
    ["r", "https://some-nostr-city-ticket-selling-webiste.com", "buy a ticket to nostr city now."],
    ["image", "https://this-guy-and-his-friend-pic.com/pic.png"],
    ["location", "<nostr-land-location>"],
    ["expiration", "1692845589"]
  ],
}
```

The clients MAY show the picture at the center (and set restrictions for size of image), content as caption, p tags as mentioned people, location as the location of picture probably with a link to map apps and r as a link that can be swiped and open, second `r` tag value can be shown instead of the link.

A story with no medias included, can show caption as the main content.

## Notes

Any other status types can be used but they are not defined by this NIP.

The status MAY include an `r`, `p`, `location`, `e` or `a` tag linking to a URL, profile, location, note, or addressable event.

The `content` MAY include emoji(s), or [NIP-30](30.md) custom emoji(s). If the `content` is an empty string then the client should clear the status.

# Client behavior

Clients MAY display this next to the username on posts or profiles to provide live user status information.

# Use Cases

* Calendar nostr apps that update your general status when you're in a meeting.
* Nostr Nests that update your general status with a link to the nest when you join.
* Nostr music streaming services that update your music status when you're listening.
* Podcasting apps that update your music status when you're listening to a podcast, with a link for others to listen as well.
* Clients can use the system media player to update playing music status.
