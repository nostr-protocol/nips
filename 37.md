NUDs
----

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines the creation of **NUD**s: _Nostr Unofficial Documents_, which are descriptions of standards and sub-standards, including those that do not pertain to this NIPs repo.

Anyone can create a NUD and they are immediately valid as soon as they are published. NUDs have owners and can be modified by these owners at any time, but they can also be forked or reinterpreted by others. However as implementations of these specs mature they will naturally coalesce into some accepted definition and it won't be possible for anyone to change that anymore in practice (even if they change the document, the Schelling point will just move to some other document or other set of documents).

NUDs are defined as kind `30817` events.

They MUST contain the following tags:

* `d` : a hyphenated, lowercase version of the title
* `title` : a human-readable name
* `description` : the naddr for the source wiki spec or a hyperlink to a different location
* `nip` : either contains "NUD" or the associated NIP identifier (such as "NIP-37")
* `status` : the state that the NUD is in `draft`, `active`, or `deprecated`

They MAY contain the following tags:

* `summary` : a prose description of the purpose of the specification
* `k` : array containing the kinds defined in the spec, in the format `kind-num:kind-name`
* `t` : array containing all of the json tags included in the spec, in the format `tag-name:tag-description`

The `content` field MAY contain one of the following:

  * an empty string
  * Asciidoc-markup text of the original or subsequent specification
  * scenarios in the [https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/](gherkin syntax).

For example:

```jsonc

      ["k", "10773:ordinal comment", "10774:ordinal label"],
      ["t", "o:satoshi number", "t:hashtags"]
    ],
    "content": "= Ordinals Comments\n\nThis NUD defines how to comment on Bitcoin Ordinals using Nostr events.\n\nEvents should be of kind 10773 for comments and kind 10774 for labels include a tag in the format [\"o\", \"1928604426675219\"] in which 1928604426675219 is the satoshi number given by `ord`. And it can include the tag `t` for some appropriate hashtags. Aside from that these events follow the rules of kind 1.",
    "sig": "76bc8a799bb1f419a74b177e38ddb372358bc21f074848a8b8f1d9f21fc1d7d1f09ffe9d9fcc41ed7de405e102bb205100aadaa1e51ee54289e58f40ba55a8fd"
}

```

Aside from this, NUD events follow any applicable rules of [NIP-54](54.md).
