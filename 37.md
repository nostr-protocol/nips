Editable Short Notes
--------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP creates an editable version of `kind:1`'s short notes using `kind:31001`. 

`kind:31001` operates in the same way `kind:1` does, with the same content structure and tagging options, including threading and markers. The only difference is that for each `e` tag pointing to another `kind:31001`, the equivalent `a` tag MUST also be created. 

A `d`-tag holds the identifier for further edits. The optional `published_at` keeps the original publication date. 

For example:

```js
{
  "kind": 31001,
  "pubkey": "<32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<Random UUID>"]
    ["e", "<event_id>", "<relay>", "root"],
    ["e", "<event_id>", "<relay>", "reply"],
    ["a", "<kind>:<pubkey>:<d-identifier>", "<relay>", "root"]
    ["a", "<kind>:<pubkey>:<d-identifier>", "<relay>", "reply"]
  ],
  "content": "this is an editable short note",
  // ...other fields
}
```
