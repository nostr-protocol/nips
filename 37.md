Editable Short Notes
--------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP allows `.content` modification of `kind:1` short notes while keeping a history of all changes.  

`kind:1010` stores the updated content with an `e` tag pointing back to the `kind:1` id. 

```js
{
  "kind": 1010,
  "pubkey": "<32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<kind_1_event_id>"]
  ],
  "content": "this is a modified version of the original content",
  // ...other fields
}
```

Clients MUST check if the pubkey of the `kind:1010` is the same as the referenced `kind:1`. 

Clients SHOULD render the `.content` of the most recent `kind:1010` by `created_at`.

Clients MAY present a history of changes over time. 

# Collaboration

`kind:1010` that are not signed by the author of the `e`-tagged event are considered proposals to change. 

```js
{
  "kind": 1010,
  "pubkey": "<32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<kind_1_event_id>"]
    ["p", "<kind_1_event_pubkey>"] // notifying the author
    ["summary", "<message to the author>"] 
  ],
  "content": "this is the proposed change from a third-party to the author",
  // ...other fields
}
```

To accept a proposal, the author signs a new `kind:1010` event with a copy of the `.content`.
