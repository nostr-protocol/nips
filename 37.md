Editable Short Notes
--------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP adds content modification directly to `kind:1` short notes. 

`kind:31010` stores the updated content with a `d` tag pointing back to the `kind:1` id. 

```js
{
  "kind": 31010,
  "pubkey": "<32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<kind_10_event_id>"]
  ],
  "content": "this is a modified note",
  // ...other fields
}
```

Clients MUST check if the pubkey of the `kind:31010` is the same as the referenced `kind:1`
