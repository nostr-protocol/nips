Editable Short Notes
--------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP creates a content-editable version of `kind:1`'s short notes using `kind:10` for tags and `kind:31010` for content. 

The usual `kind:1` note is separated into 2 kinds: 
- `kind:10` receives the tags related to the note. 
- `kind:31010` receives the content.

To improve loading time, `kind:10`'s `.content` contains the stringified version of the first `kind:31010` created for this post. 

Clients SHOULD seek updated versions as the user navigates the feed.

For example:

```js
{
  "kind": 10,
  "pubkey": "<32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<event_id>", "<relay>", "root"],
    ["e", "<event_id>", "<relay>", "reply"],
    ["content", "<kind>:<pubkey>:<d-identifier>", "<relay>"]
  ],
  "content": "<JSON.stringify(first kind:31010)>",
  // ...other fields
}
```

`kind:31010` then stores the content with a `d` tag with the `kind:10` id. 

```js
{
  "kind": 31010,
  "pubkey": "<32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<kind_10_event_id>"]
  ],
  "content": "this is an editable short note",
  // ...other fields
}
```
