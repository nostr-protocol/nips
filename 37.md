Editable Short Notes
--------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP allows `.content` modification on `kind:1` short notes while keeping a history of all changes.  

`kind:1010` stores the updated content with a `e` tag pointing back to the `kind:1` id. 

```js
{
  "kind": 1010,
  "pubkey": "<32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<kind_1_event_id>"]
  ],
  "content": "this is a modified version of the original content",
  // ...other fields
}
```

Clients MUST check if the pubkey of the `kind:1010` is the same as the referenced `kind:1`

Clients SHOULD render the `.content` of the most recent `kind:1010` by `created_at`

Clients MAY present a history of changes over time.
