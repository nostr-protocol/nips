NIP-99
======

Classified Listings
-------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines `kind:30402`: an addressable event to describe classified listings that list any arbitrary product, service, or other thing for sale or offer and includes enough structured metadata to make them useful.

The specification supports a broad range of use cases physical goods, services, work opportunities, rentals, free giveaways, personals, etc. To promote interoperability between clients implementing NIP-99 for e-commerce, you can find the extension proposal [here](https://github.com/GammaMarkets/market-spec/blob/main/spec.md) which standardizes the e-commerce use case while maintaining the specification's lightweight and flexible nature. While [NIP-15](15.md) provides a strictly structured marketplace specification, NIP-99 has emerged as a simpler and more flexible alternative.

The structure of these events is very similar to [NIP-23](23.md) long-form content events.

### Draft / Inactive Listings

`kind:30403` has the same structure as `kind:30402` and is used to save draft or inactive classified listings.

### Content

The `.content` field should be a description of what is being offered and by whom. These events should be a string in Markdown syntax.

### Author

The `.pubkey` field of these events are treated as the party creating the listing.

### Metadata

- For "tags"/"hashtags" (i.e. categories or keywords of relevance for the listing) the `"t"` event tag should be used.
- For images, whether included in the markdown content or not, clients SHOULD use `image` tags as described in [NIP-58](58.md). This allows clients to display images in carousel format more easily.

The following tags, used for structured metadata, are standardized and SHOULD be included. Other tags may be added as necessary.

- `"title"`, a title for the listing
- `"summary"`, for short tagline or summary for the listing
- `"published_at"`, for the timestamp (in unix seconds – converted to string) of the first time the listing was published.
- `"location"`, for the location.
- `"price"`, for the price of the thing being listed. This is an array in the format `[ "price", "<number>", "<currency>", "<frequency>" ]`.
  - `"price"` is the name of the tag
  - `"<number>"` is the amount in numeric format (but included in the tag as a string)
  - `"<currency>"` is the currency unit in 3-character ISO 4217 format or ISO 4217-like currency code (e.g. `"btc"`, `"eth"`).
  - `"<frequency>"` is optional and can be used to describe recurring payments. SHOULD be in noun format (hour, day, week, month, year, etc.)
- `"status"` (optional), the status of the listing. SHOULD be either "active" or "sold".

#### `price` examples

- $50 one-time payment `["price", "50", "USD"]`
- €15 per month `["price", "15", "EUR", "month"]`
- £50,000 per year `["price", "50000", "GBP", "year"]`

Other common tags that might be useful.

- `"g"`, a geohash for more precise location
