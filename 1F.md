Recommended Notes
-----------------

`draft` `optional`

Recommended notes are events used to bring awareness to content
for a user's followers.

They have the same structure of [NIP-22](22.md) comments but use
different event kinds to ease filtering in contrast to reusing
`kind:1111` and adding indexable tags.

## Renote

Renotes are `kind:1112` events. They have the same tag structure of `kind:1111`
events but have an empty `.content`. They should not be loaded as part of a thread
but are expected to appear on an app's main "feed", showing the parent item
content.

## Root Comment

Root Comments are `kind:1113` events. Their structure is exactly like `kind:1111`
events. Unlike renotes, they do have `.content`.

Like `kind:1111` events, they should be loaded as part of a thread,
along with other regular and root comments.

The difference to `kind:1111` events is that root comments are also
expected to be loaded on an app's main "feed".

### Implementing Root Comments

As a suggestion, top-level comments (not a reply to another comment) by default
should be `kind:1113` events, with the user being able to **opt-out** with a toggle,
which would simply make the app post a `kind:1111` event instead.

For deeper comments, users should be able to **opt-in** to using `kind:1113`,
because the deeper the comment level, higher is the chance of it being valuable
just to the parent comment's author.

That is, by default, replies to root events (e.g. replies to `kind:30023` events)
should be `kind:1113` events, while replies to `kind:1113` or `kind:1111` events
should be `kind:1111` events.
