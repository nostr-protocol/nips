Root Comment
------------

`draft` `optional`

Root Comments structure-wise are exactly like [NIP-22](22.md) comments except
for being `kind:1112`.

The difference is that they are also loaded on an app's main "feed", in addition
to being loaded on a thread alongside regular `kind:1111` comments.

With `kind:1112`, the user is able to surface any comment too deep in a thread
that would otherwise not be easily reachable by their audience.

### Implementation

As a suggestion, top-level comments (not a reply to another comment) by default
could be `kind:1112` events, with the user being able to **opt-out** with a toggle,
which would simply make the app post a `kind:1111` event instead.

For deeper comments, users should be able to **opt-in** to using `kind:1112`,
because the deeper the comment level, higher is the chance of it being valuable
just to the parent comment's author.

That is, by default, replies to root events (e.g. replies to `kind:30023` events)
could be `kind:1112` events, while replies to `kind:1112` or `kind:1111` events
should be `kind:1111` events.
