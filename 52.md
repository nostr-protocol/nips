Calendar Events
---------------

`draft` `optional`

This specification defines calendar events representing an occurrence at a specific moment or between moments. These calendar events are _addressable_ and deletable per [NIP-09](09.md).

Unlike the term `calendar event` specific to this NIP, the term `event` is used broadly in all the NIPs to describe any Nostr event. The distinction is being made here to discern between the two terms.

## Calendar Events

There are two types of calendar events represented by different kinds: _date-based_ and _time-based_ calendar events.

These tags are common to both types of calendar events:

* `d` (required) a short unique string identifier. Generated by the client creating the calendar event.
* `title` (required) title of the calendar event
* `summary` (optional) brief description of the calendar event
* `image` (optional) url of an image to use for the event
* `location` (optional, repeated) location of the calendar event. e.g. address, GPS coordinates, meeting room name, link to video call
* `g` (optional) [geohash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash) to associate calendar event with a searchable physical location
* `p` (optional, repeated) 32-bytes hex pubkey of a participant, optional recommended relay URL, and participant's role in the meeting
* `t` (optional, repeated) hashtag to categorize calendar event
* `r` (optional, repeated) references / links to web pages, documents, video calls, recorded videos, etc.
* `a` (repeated) reference tag to kind `31924` calendar event requesting to be included in Calendar

The following tags are deprecated:

* `name` name of the calendar event. Use only if `title` is not available.

Calendar events are _not_ required to be part of a [calendar](#calendar).

## Collaborative Calendar Event Requests

Calendar events can include an `a` tag referencing a calendar (kind 31924) to request addition to that calendar. When a calendar event includes such a reference, clients should interpret this as a request to add the event to the referenced calendar by referencing it with an `a` tag.

This enables collaborative calendar management where multiple users can contribute events to calendars they do not own, subject to the calendar owner's approval.

### Date-Based Calendar Event

This kind of calendar event starts on a date and ends before a different date in the future. Its use is appropriate for all-day or multi-day events where time and time zone hold no significance. e.g., anniversary, public holidays, vacation days.

It's an _addressable event_ of `kind:31922`.

The `.content` of these events SHOULD be a description of the calendar event.

Aside from the common tags, this also takes the following tags:

* `start` (required) inclusive start date in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). Must be less than `end`, if it exists.
* `end` (optional) exclusive end date in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). If omitted, the calendar event ends on the same date as `start`.

Example:

```yaml
{
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded SHA-256 of the the serialized event data>,
  "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "kind": 31922,
  "content": "<description of calendar event>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<random-identifier>"],

    ["title", "<title of calendar event>"],

    // dates
    ["start", "<YYYY-MM-DD>"],
    ["end", "<YYYY-MM-DD>"],

    // location
    ["location", "<location>"],
    ["g", "<geohash>"],

    // participants
    ["p", "<32-bytes hex of a pubkey>", "<optional recommended relay URL>", "<role>"],
    ["p", "<32-bytes hex of a pubkey>", "<optional recommended relay URL>", "<role>"],
  ]
}
```

### Time-Based Calendar Event

This kind of calendar event spans between a start time and end time.

It's an _addressable event_ of `kind:31923`.

The `.content` of these events should be a description of the calendar event. It is required but can be an empty string.

Aside from the common tags, this also takes the following tags:

* `start` (required) inclusive start Unix timestamp in seconds. Must be less than `end`, if it exists.
* `end` (optional) exclusive end Unix timestamp in seconds. If omitted, the calendar event ends instantaneously.
* `start_tzid` (optional) time zone of the start timestamp, as defined by the IANA Time Zone Database. e.g., `America/Costa_Rica`
* `end_tzid` (optional) time zone of the end timestamp, as defined by the IANA Time Zone Database. e.g., `America/Costa_Rica`. If omitted and `start_tzid` is provided, the time zone of the end timestamp is the same as the start timestamp.

```yaml
{
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded SHA-256 of the the serialized event data>,
  "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "kind": 31923,
  "content": "<description of calendar event>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<random-identifier>"],

    ["title", "<title of calendar event>"],
    ["summary", "<brief description of the calendar event>"],
    ["image", "<string with image URI>"],

    // timestamps
    ["start", "<unix timestamp in seconds>"],
    ["end", "<unix timestamp in seconds>"],

    ["start_tzid", "<IANA Time Zone Database identifier>"],
    ["end_tzid", "<IANA Time Zone Database identifier>"],

    // location
    ["location", "<location>"],
    ["g", "<geohash>"],

    // participants
    ["p", "<32-bytes hex of a pubkey>", "<optional recommended relay URL>", "<role>"],
    ["p", "<32-bytes hex of a pubkey>", "<optional recommended relay URL>", "<role>"],
  ]
}
```

## Calendar

A calendar is a collection of calendar events, represented as a custom _addressable list_ event using kind `31924`. A user can have multiple calendars. One may create a calendar to segment calendar events for specific purposes. e.g., personal, work, travel, meetups, and conferences.

Calendars can accept event requests from other users. When calendar events reference a calendar via an `a` tag, this represents a request for inclusion.

The `.content` of these events should be a detailed description of the calendar. It is required but can be an empty string.

* `d` (required) universally unique identifier. Generated by the client creating the calendar.
* `title` (required) calendar title
* `a` (repeated) reference tag to kind `31922` or `31923` calendar event being responded to

```yaml
{
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded SHA-256 of the the serialized event data>,
  "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "kind": 31924,
  "content": "<description of calendar>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<random-identifier>"],
    ["title", "<calendar title>"],
    ["a", "<31922 or 31923>:<calendar event author pubkey>:<d-identifier of calendar event>", "<optional relay url>"],
    ["a", "<31922 or 31923>:<calendar event author pubkey>:<d-identifier of calendar event>", "<optional relay url>"]
  ]
}
```

## Calendar Event RSVP

A calendar event RSVP is a response to a calendar event to indicate a user's attendance intention.

If a calendar event tags a pubkey, that can be interpreted as the calendar event creator inviting that user to attend. Clients MAY choose to prompt the user to RSVP for the calendar event.

Any user may RSVP, even if they were not tagged on the calendar event. Clients MAY choose to prompt the calendar event creator to invite the user who RSVP'd. Clients also MAY choose to ignore these RSVPs.

This NIP is intentionally not defining who is authorized to attend a calendar event if the user who RSVP'd has not been tagged. It is up to the calendar event creator to determine the semantics.

This NIP is also intentionally not defining what happens if a calendar event changes after an RSVP is submitted.

The RSVP MUST have an `a` tag of the event coordinates to the calendar event, and optionally an `e` tag of the id of the specific calendar event revision. If an `e` tag is present, clients SHOULD interpret it as an indication that the RSVP is a response to that revision of the calendar event, and MAY interpret it to not necessarily apply to other revisions of the calendar event.

The RSVP MAY tag the author of the calendar event it is in response to using a `p` tag so that clients can easily query all RSVPs that pertain to the author.

The RSVP is an _addressable event_ of `kind:31925`.

The `.content` of these events is optional and should be a free-form note that adds more context to this calendar event response.

The list of tags is as follows:

* `a` (required) coordinates to a kind `31922` or `31923` calendar event being responded to.
* `e` (optional) event id of a kind `31922` or `31923` calendar event being responded to.
* `d` (required) universally unique identifier. Generated by the client creating the calendar event RSVP.
* `status` (required) `accepted`, `declined`, or `tentative`. Determines attendance status to the referenced calendar event.
* `fb` (optional) `free` or `busy`. Determines if the user would be free or busy for the duration of the calendar event. This tag must be omitted or ignored if the `status` label is set to `declined`.
* `p` (optional) pubkey of the author of the calendar event being responded to.

```yaml
{
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded SHA-256 of the the serialized event data>,
  "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "kind": 31925,
  "content": "<note>",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<kind 31922 or 31923 event id", "<optional recommended relay URL>"]
    ["a", "<31922 or 31923>:<calendar event author pubkey>:<d-identifier of calendar event>", "<optional recommended relay URL>"],
    ["d", "<random-identifier>"],
    ["status", "<accepted/declined/tentative>"],
    ["fb", "<free/busy>"],
    ["p", "<hex pubkey of kind 31922 or 31923 event>", "<optional recommended relay URL>"]
  ]
}
```

## Unsolved Limitations

* No private events

## Intentionally Unsupported Scenarios

### Recurring Calendar Events

Recurring calendar events come with a lot of complexity, making it difficult for software and humans to deal with. This complexity includes time zone differences between invitees, daylight savings, leap years, multiple calendar systems, one-off changes in schedule or other metadata, etc.

This NIP intentionally omits support for recurring calendar events and pushes that complexity up to clients to manually implement if they desire. i.e., individual calendar events with duplicated metadata represent recurring calendar events.
