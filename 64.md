Trust Rank
----------

`draft` `optional`

A trust rank is a public way to individually assign a quantifiable level of trust on specifc topics to a nostr identity.
Ranks can be used to discover trusted people or content on a common topic.

## Event Structure

The `kind:30382` is used to assign public relationship statuses between the event author and a pubkey set to the `d` tag.
This NIP assigns one or more trust ranks by adding `T` tags with different topic names to such event
using the following structure: `["T", "<int_value_ranging_from_-3_to_3>:<topic-name>", "<context_dependent_marker>"]`.

Example:

```js
{
  "kind": 30382,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<pubkey>"],
    ["T", "3:wiki:role-playing-video-game", "x"], // has written a based wiki article about RPG
    ["T", "2:driver"], // polite and skilled driver but doesn't turn the air conditioner on
    ["T", "3:buyer"], // no problems when selling to this person
    ["T", "-2:seller"] // had a bad experience when buying from this person or company
  ],
  // ...other fields
}
```
