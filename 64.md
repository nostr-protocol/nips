Trust Rank
----------

`draft` `optional`

A trust rank is a public way to individually assign a quantifiable level of trust on specifc topics to a nostr identity.
Ranks can be used to discover trusted people or content on a common topic.

## Event Structure

The `kind:30382` is used to assign public relationship statuses between the event author and a pubkey set to the `d` tag.
This NIP assigns one or more trust ranks by adding `T` tags with different topic names to such event
using the following structure: `["T", "<int_value_ranging_from_-3_to_3>:<topic-name>"]`.

Example:

```js
{
  "kind": 30382,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<pubkey>"],
    ["T", "3:wiki:role-playing-video-game"], // has written a based wiki article about RPG
    ["T", "2:driver"], // polite and skilled driver but doesn't turn the air conditioner on
    ["T", "3:buyer"], // no problems when selling to this person
    ["T", "-2:seller"] // had a bad experience when buying from this person or company
  ],
  // ...other fields
}
```

If a client doesn't recognize a topic name, it should leave the corresponding `T` tag untouched. For example,
a wiki client will only add/update/remove `T` tags with topic names starting with `wiki:`, as explained on [NIP-54](#54.md).

## Trust by Rank Value

|trusted a lot|somewhat trusted|a bit trusted|neutral|a bit untrusted|somewhat untrusted|untrusted a lot|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|3|2|1|0|-1|-2|-3|

### Filtering

The reason why the rating score (integer value) has few possible values and is placed together with the topic name
is for letting client filter by both data.

Example filters:

- Good drivers: `{ "kinds": [30382], "#T": ["3:driver", "2:driver", "1:driver"] }`
- Best merchants: `{ "kinds": [30382], "#T": ["3:seller"] }`
