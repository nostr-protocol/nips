Relay List Metadata
-------------------

`draft` `optional`

Defines a replaceable event using `kind:10002` to advertise relays where the user generally **writes** to and relays where the user generally **reads** mentions.

The event MUST include a list of `r` tags with relay URLs as value and an optional `read` or `write` marker. If the marker is omitted, the relay is both **read** and **write**.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 10002,
  "tags": [
    ["r", "wss://alicerelay.example.com"],
    ["r", "wss://brando-relay.com"],
    ["r", "wss://expensive-relay.example2.com", "write"],
    ["r", "wss://nostr-relay.example.com", "read"]
  ],
  "content": "",
  // other fields...
}
```

When downloading events **from** a user, clients SHOULD use the **write** relays of that user.

When downloading events **about** a user, where the user was tagged (mentioned), clients SHOULD use the user's **read** relays.

When publishing an event, clients SHOULD:

- Send the event to the **write** relays of the author
- Send the event to all **read** relays of each tagged user
- Send the author's `kind:10002` event to all relays the event was published to

### Size

Clients SHOULD guide users to keep `kind:10002` lists small (2-4 relays of each category).

### Discoverability

Clients SHOULD spread an author's `kind:10002` event to as many relays as viable, paying attention to relays that, at any moment, serve naturally as well-known public indexers for these relay lists (where most other clients and users are connecting to in order to publish and fetch those).

Clients SHOULD guide users to treat the list as prioritized, with most trusted relays (less probability of censoring events, like a personal relay) at the top. 

When seeking events **from** a user, clients SHOULD if possible start by using the relays most at the top of list, since these should be the most trusted by the user.
