Relay List Metadata
-------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:mikedilger` `author:vitorpamplona`

Defines a replaceable event using `kind:10002` to advertise preferred relays for discovering a user's content and receiving fresh content from others.

The event MUST include a list of `r` tags with relay URIs and a `read` or `write` marker. If the marker is omitted, the relay is used for both purposes.

The `.content` is not used.

```json
{
  "kind": 10002,
  "tags": [
    ["r", "wss://alicerelay.example.com"],
    ["r", "wss://brando-relay.com"],
    ["r", "wss://expensive-relay.example2.com", "write"],
    ["r", "wss://nostr-relay.example.com", "read"],
  ],
  "content": "",
  ...other fields
```

This NIP doesn't fully replace relay lists that are designed to configure a client's usage of relays (such as `kind:3` style relay lists). Clients MAY use other relay lists in situations where a `kind:10002` relay list cannot be found.

## When to Use Read and Write

When seeking events **from** a user, Clients SHOULD use the WRITE relays of the user's `kind:10002`

When seeking events **about** a user, where the user was tagged, Clients SHOULD use the READ relays of the user's `kind:10002` 

When broadcasting an event, Clients SHOULD:

- Broadcast the event to the WRITE relays of the author
- Broadcast the event all READ relays of each tagged user. 

## Motivation

The old model of using a fixed relay list per user centralizes in large relay operators: 

  - Most users submit their posts to the same highly popular relays, aiming to achieve greater visibility among a broader audience.
  - Many users are pulling events from a large number of relays in order to get more data at the expense of duplication
  - Events are being copied between relays, oftentimes to many different relays
  
This NIP allows Clients to connect directly with the most up-to-date relay set from each individual user, eliminating the need of broadcasting events to popular relays. 

## Final Considerations

1. Clients should guide users to keep `kind:10002` lists small (2-4 relays). 

2. Clients should spread an author's `kind:10002` events to as many relays as viable. 

3. `kind:10002` events should only be used to advertise the user's preferred relays. The Client's configuration should stay in other lists where other factors can be considered, such as specific relays for a given UI feature of the Client.

4. DMs should be broadcasted to the author's WRITE relays and to the receiver's READ relays to keep maximum privacy.
