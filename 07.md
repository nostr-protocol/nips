`window.nostr` capability for web browsers
------------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:fiatjaf`

The `window.nostr` object may be made available by web browsers or extensions and websites or web-apps may make use of it after checking its availability.

That object must define the following methods:

```
async window.nostr.getPublicKey(): string // returns a public key as hex
async window.nostr.signEvent(event: Event): Event // takes an event object and returns it with the `sig`
```

### Implementation example

- [nos2x](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nos2x) is available as a Chromium (and partially Firefox) extension that provides such capabilities.
