End of Stored Events Notice
---------------------------

`final` `mandatory` `author:Semisol`

Relays MUST support notifying clients when all stored events have been sent.

The relay MUST send the client an `EOSE` message in the format `["EOSE", <subscription_id>]` after it has sent all the events it has persisted and it indicates all the events that come after this message are newly published.

Client Behavior
---------------

Clients may use the `supported_nips` field to learn if a relay supports end of stored events notices.
Clients MUST unsubscribe when they get an `EOSE` message from the relay.
