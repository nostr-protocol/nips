Reporting
---------

`draft` `optional` `author:jb55`

A report is a `kind 1984` note that is used to report other notes for spam,
illegal and explicit content.

The content MAY contain additional information submitted by the entity
reporting the content.

Tags
----

The report event MUST include a `p` tag referencing the pubkey of the user you
are reporting.

If reporting a note, an `e` tag MUST also be included referencing the note id.

A `report` tag MUST be included which consists of the following report types:

- `explicit` - explicit content which may not be appropriate for minors: nudity, profanity, etc
- `illegal` - something which may be illegal in some jurisdiction
- `spam` - spam
- `impersonation` - someone pretending to be someone else

Some report tags only make sense for profile reports, such as `impersonation`

Example code

```swift
enum ReportType: String {
    case explicit
    case illegal
    case spam
    case impersonation
}

func create_report_tags(target: ReportTarget, type: ReportType) -> [[String]] {
    var tags: [[String]]
    switch target {
    case .user(let pubkey):
        tags = [["p", pubkey]]
    case .note(let notet):
        tags = [["e", notet.note_id], ["p", notet.pubkey]]
    }

    tags.append(["report", type.rawValue])
    return tags
}
```

Client behavior
---------------

Clients can use reports from friends to make moderation decisions if they
choose to. For instance, if 3+ of your friends report a profile as explicit,
clients can have an option to automatically blur photos from said account.


Relay behavior
--------------

It is not recommended that relays perform automatic moderation using reports,
as they can be easily gamed. Admins could use reports from trusted moderators to
takedown illegal or explicit content if the relays do not allow such things.
