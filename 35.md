NIP-35
======

Torrents
--------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defined a new `kind 2003` which is a Torrent. 

`kind 2003` is a simple torrent index where there is enough information to search for content and construct the magnet link. No torrent files exist on nostr.

## Tags
- `x`: V1 BitTorrent Info Hash, as seen in the [magnet link](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0053.html) `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:HASH`
- `file`: A file entry inside the torrent, including the full path ie. `info/example.txt`
- `tracker`: (Optional) A tracker to use for this torrent

In order to make torrents searchable by general category, you SHOULD include a few tags like `movie`, `tv`, `HD`, `UHD` etc.

## Tag prefixes

Tag prefixes are used to label the content with references, ie. `["i", "imdb:1234"]`

- `tcat`: A comma separated text category path, ie. `["i", "tcat:video,movie,4k"]`, this should also match the `newznab` category in a best effort approach.
- `newznab`: The category ID from [newznab](https://github.com/Prowlarr/Prowlarr/blob/develop/src/NzbDrone.Core/Indexers/NewznabStandardCategory.cs)
- `tmdb`: [The movie database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) id.
- `ttvdb`: [TV database](https://thetvdb.com/) id.
- `imdb`: [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) id.
- `mal`: [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) id.
- `anilist`: [AniList](https://anilist.co/) id.

A second level prefix should be included where the database supports multiple media types.
- `tmdb:movie:693134` maps to `themoviedb.org/movie/693134`
- `ttvdb:movie:290272` maps to `thetvdb.com/movies/dune-part-two`
- `mal:anime:9253` maps to `myanimelist.net/anime/9253`
- `mal:manga:17517` maps to `myanimelist.net/manga/17517`

In some cases the url mapping isnt direct, mapping the url in general is out of scope for this NIP, the section above is only a guide so that implementers have enough information to succsesfully map the url if they wish.

```json
{
  "kind": 2003,
  "content": "<long-description-pre-formatted>",
  "tags": [
    ["title", "<torrent-title>"],
    ["x", "<bittorrent-info-hash>"],
    ["file", "<file-name>", "<file-size-in-bytes>"],
    ["file", "<file-name>", "<file-size-in-bytes>"],
    ["tracker", "udp://mytacker.com:1337"],
    ["tracker", "http://1337-tracker.net/announce"],
    ["i", "tcat:video,movie,4k"],
    ["i", "newznab:2045"],
    ["i", "imdb:tt15239678"],
    ["i", "tmdb:movie:693134"],
    ["i", "ttvdb:movie:290272"],
    ["t", "movie"],
    ["t", "4k"],
  ]
}
```

## Torrent Comments

A torrent comment is a `kind 2004` event which is used to reply to a torrent event.

This event works exactly like a `kind 1` and should follow `NIP-10` for tagging.
