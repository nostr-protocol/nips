New NIP - Defined vocabulary for NIP-36 and NIP-56

(NIP-69?)

Context:

To be used effectively all forms of content reporting - whether self-reporting (via NIP-36) or 3rd party reporting (via NIP-56) need to be aligned in how they operate. A common, translatable "vocabulary" to use in those reports is the first step in aligning their use.

These categories and contexts represent the types of content that relay owners and sites hosting client apps may need to filter to be compliant with local laws or to tailor the content on their site or relay to the standards of the community they support.



Disclaimer:

The fact that something is on this list says nothing about the ethical or moral quality of the content.

A NIP-36 or NIP-56 report is not a suggestion to censor content, nor are they endorsements of censorship. Nostr is specifically designed to prevent any mandate to use NIP-36 or NIP-56 data. The data exists simply for contexts where it is needed or desired. Apps that support NIP-36 and NIP-56 reporting do not need to support all of the types and contexts listed below or present them to users. Likewise it's likely that many relays will instruct their moderators to ignore all the report types except those which pose serious legal issues for their organization.

Some of the content types involve "in the eye of the beholder" judgement calls. Relay owners and Nostr-based communities will use and/or ignore reports only as the reports meet their particular standards. There won't be a single standard on any of these items, but rather thousands of standards.

To reiterate - there is no way to censor Nostr. This isn't about censorship. It's about facilitating the content moderation necessary to be compliant with local laws and community standards that define the community of users for a particular relay or client app.



Reportable Types:

These types expand and standardize the "report types" defined in NIP-56. Existing NIP-56 report types (shown below as "sometype | ...") should be supported by clients for backwards compatibility, but should not otherwise be used in future development.

Format: AB-cde
 - where 'AB' is a mandatory 2 character, uppercase code of a major content type category
 - and 'cde' is an optional 3 character, lowercase code representing a sub-category

Use with NIP-56 3rd party reports:

To use with NIP-56 simply replace the original 5 defined report types with the 2 or 6 character codes above.

The one change to NIP-56 (or clarification) is that the value passed may be a comma delimited list to support specifying multiple report types or contexts.



Use with NIP-36 self-reporting:

An additional, second option is added to the content-warning tag - [codes] - which contains a comma delimited list of relevant content type and context codes.

If NIP-36 is being used to self-report one's profile the user may either classify the entire profile or just parts of a profile by appending the item name for the applicable part of the profile to the content type or context code. For example,

AB-cde (would apply to the entire profile)
AB-cde-picture (would apply to the user's avatar only)
AB-cde-website (would apply to the link in the user's profile)

Item names used must match items specified in 'content' section of the Kind 0 event.



Translation:

The descriptions for each type and context code will need to be translated into other languages to facilitate international use.



Future-proofing:

It is expected that the content moderation for Nostr will evolve over time and other types of data may be added to the reports. As a result, any data after an expected code should be ignored.



Discussion:

The need for some of the categories is obvious, but here are reasons why some of the less obvious ones are included...

Intolerance & Hate (IH) is clearly in the eye of the beholder and it's likely that it will be ignored by the majority of relays. But filtering on intolerance and hate is necessary to facilitate the development of safe spaces on Nostr for vulnerable minority groups who are themselves often the target of intolerance and hate.

Misinformation is an extremely touchy issue. If you notice there's no general MI code. Instead misinformation is only supported for "Your money or your life" situations - where serious harm can come to the user.

It may seem having both "nudity & sex" (NS) and "pornography" (PN) as categories is redundant. Yes there is overlap between them, but "pornography" is more of a context while "nudity & sex" is more of a content type. Each is capable of giving relevant information the other can't give.

Prostitution (IL-hkr) is only on the list because of FOSTA/SESTA - which is the one exception to CDA Section 230 and has to be taken seriously by all US-based relays.
