# NIPs

NIPs stand for **Nostr Implementation Possibilities**. They exist to document what MUST, what SHOULD and what MAY be implemented by [Nostr](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr)-compatible _relay_ and _client_ software.

## Criteria for acceptance of NIPs

1. They should be implemented somewhere at least as a prototype somewhere.
2. They should make sense.
3. Other rules will be made up when necessary.
