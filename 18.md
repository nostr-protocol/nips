A repost is a `kind 6` note that is used to signal to followers
that another event is worth reading.

The `content` of a repost event is empty. Optionally, it MAY contain
the stringified JSON of the reposted note event for quick look up.

The repost event MUST include an `e` tag with the `id` of the note that is
being reposted. That tag MUST include a relay URL as its third entry
to indicate where it can be fetched.

The repost SHOULD include a `p` tag with the `pubkey` of the event being
reposted.

## Reposting Parameterized Replaceable Events

When reposting events of kind `30000 <= n < 40000`, a parameterised replaceable event as defined by [NIP-33](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/33.md), the repost SHOULD also include an `a` tag with fields `<kind>:<pubkey>:<d-identifier>`  and `relay-url`. This allows the most recent version of the parameterised event to be retrieved even if the original event is no longer available.

## Quote Reposts

Quote reposts are `kind 1` events with an embedded `e` tag (see [NIP-08](08.md) and [NIP-27](27.md)).
Because a quote repost includes an `e` tag, it may show up along replies to the reposted note.
