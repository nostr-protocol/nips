Reposts
-------

`draft` `optional`

A repost is a `kind 6` event that is used to signal to followers
that a `kind 1` text note is worth reading.

The `content` of a repost event is _the stringified JSON of the reposted note_. It MAY also be empty, but that is not recommended.

The repost event MUST include an `e` tag with the `id` of the note that is
being reposted. That tag MUST include a relay URL as its third entry
to indicate where it can be fetched.

The repost SHOULD include a `p` tag with the `pubkey` of the event being
reposted.

## Generic Reposts

Since `kind 6` reposts are reserved for `kind 1` contents, we use `kind 16`
as a "generic repost", that can include any kind of event inside other than
`kind 1`.

`kind 16` reposts SHOULD contain a `k` tag with the stringified kind number
of the reposted event as its value.

## Quote Reposts

Quote reposts are `kind 1` events with an embedded `q` tag of the note being
quote reposted. The `q` tag ensures quote reposts are not pulled and included
as replies in threads. It also allows you to easily pull and count all of the
quotes for a post.

`q` tags should follow the same conventions as NIP 10 `e` tags, with the exception
of the `mark` argument. The first argument MAY be either an event id or an address.

`["q", <event-id-or-address>, <relay-url>, <pubkey>]`

Quote reposts MUST include the bech32-encoded `nevent`, `note`, or `naddr` of the
event in the content. The embedded entity should match the type of the tag (in
other words, if embedding a `naddr`, the `q` tag should contain an address, not
an event id).
