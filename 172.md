NIP-172
=======

Moderated Communities (Reddit Style)
------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:vitorpamplona`

The goal of this NIP is to create moderator-approved public communities around a topic. It defines the replaceable event `34550` to define the community and the current list of moderators/administrators. Users that want to post into the community, simply tag any Nostr event with an `a` tag. Moderators issue an approval event `34551` that links the community with the new post.

# Community definition

Kind 34550 should include any field that helps define the community and the set of moderators.

```js
{
  "id": "<32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded SHA-256 of the the serialized event data>",
  "pubkey": "<32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>",
  "created_at": "<Unix timestamp in seconds>",
  "kind": 34550,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<community_name>"],
    ["description", "<community_description>"],
    ["image",  "<community_image>", "WidthxHeight"],
	
    //.. other tags relevant to defining the community

    // moderators
    ["p", "<32-bytes hex of a pubkey>", "<optional recommended relay URL>", "moderator"],
    ["p", "<32-bytes hex of a pubkey>", "<optional recommended relay URL>", "moderator"],
    ["p", "<32-bytes hex of a pubkey>", "<optional recommended relay URL>", "moderator"],
	
    // relays used by the community 
    ["relay", "<relay hosting author kind 0>", "author"],
    ["relay", "<relay where to post requests to and fetch approvals from>"], 
    ["relay", "<relay where to post requests to and fetch approvals from>"]
  ]
}
```

# New Post Request

Any Nostr event can be a post request. Clients should simply add the community's `a` tag to be presented for the moderator's approval.

```js
{
  "id": "<32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded SHA-256 of the the serialized event data>",
  "pubkey": "<32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>",
  "created_at": "<Unix timestamp in seconds>",
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [
    ["a", "34550:<community event author pubkey>:<d-identifier of the community>", "<optional relay url>"],
  ], 
  "content": "<my content>"
}
```

Community management clients can filter all mentions of the kind-34550 event and request moderators to approve each submission. The same moderator can remove his/her approval of the post at any time.

# Post Approval by moderators

The post-approval event includes a stringified `new post request` event inside the `.content` of the approval (NIP-18-style).

```js
{
  "id": "<32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded SHA-256 of the the serialized event data>",
  "pubkey": "<32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>",
  "created_at": "<Unix timestamp in seconds>",
  "kind": "34551",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "34550:<community event author pubkey>:<d-identifier of the community>", "<optional relay url>"],
    ["e", "<Post Request ID>", "<optional relay url>"],
    ["p", "<Post Request Author ID>", "<optional relay url>"],
    ["k", "<New Post Request kind>"],
  ], 
  "content": "{ <New Post Request JSON> }"
}
```

It's recommended that multiple moderators approve posts to avoid unapproving them when a given moderator is removed from the owner's list. In case the full list of moderators must be rotated, the new moderator set must sign post-approvals for posts in the past or the community will restart.

# Displaying

Community clients can display posts that have been approved by at least 1 moderator or by the community owner.

The following filter displays the approved posts.

```js
{
  "authors": ["<author>", "moderator1", "moderator2", "moderator3", ...],
  "kinds": 34551,
  "#a": ["34550:<community event author pubkey>:<d-identifier of the community>"],
}
```
