Handling Mentions
-----------------

`final` `optional` `author:fiatjaf` `author:scsibug`

This document standardizes the treatment given by clients of inline mentions of other events and pubkeys inside the content of `text_note`s.

Clients that want to allow tagged mentions they MUST show an autocomplete component or something analogous to that whenever the user starts typing a special key (for example, "@") or presses some button to include a mention etc -- or these clients can come up with other ways to unambiguously differentiate between mentions and normal text.

Once a mention is identified, for example, the pubkey `27866e9d854c78ae625b867eefdfa9580434bc3e675be08d2acb526610d96fbe`, the client MUST replace its textual reference (inside `.content`) with the notation `nostr:nprofile1qqsw3dy8cpu...6x2argwghx6egsqstvg` as per NIP-21. If client doesn't support NIP-21, it can instead use a regular http link to a nostr client such as `https://snort.social/p/nprofile1qqsw3dy8cpu...6x2argwghx6egsqstvg`. The client MAY add that pubkey to the `.tags` with the tag `p` if it wishes to notify mentioned user.

The same process applies for mentioning event IDs, except that the client SHOULD NOT add the event id to the `.tags` with the tag `e` so to not negatively impact thread loading.

A client that receives a `text_note` event with such `nostr:...` mentions in its `.content` CAN do any desired context augmentation (for example, linking to the pubkey or showing a preview of the mentioned event contents) it wants in the process.
