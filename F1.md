Profile Hypercustomization
--------------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP describes a new event `kind:19999` that can be used for multiple optional and weird forms of profile customization, such as extra colors, extra pictures, preferences and background music.

It's completely optional and clients may choose to fulfill only some of these tags, or none. Clients may also allow users to turn off these customizations or not.
