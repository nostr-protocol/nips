Collaborative Events
--------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:leandro21b`

## Description:

Collaborative Events are events involving several users that can be useful for applications such as publications involving several users, creation of content involving several content producers, publications by companies with the signature of several partners, public digital contracts, etc.

The event is created and signed by its creator, then he distributes the event for the other users involved to sign, sending can be done in several ways, for example through `Encrypted Direct Message KIND-4`, after the event is signed by all parties involved, it can be sent to the relays, the collaborative event can be replaceable or not, if it is not replaceable it will be identified by `KIND-70`, if it is replaceable it will be identified by `KIND-10070`

A partially signed event can also be sent to the relays, but it must be replaced every time a new signature is included, this will be detailed in the third and final example.

## Fully Signed Example:

```json
{
  "id": <id>,
  "pubkey": [<pubkey1>, <pubkey2>],
  "created_at": <created_at>,
  "kind": 70,
  "tags": [],
  "content": <content>,
  "sig": [<sig1>, <sig2>]
}
```

## Fully Signed Replaceable Example:

```json
{
  "id": <id>,
  "pubkey": [<pubkey1>, <pubkey2>],
  "created_at": <created_at>,
  "kind": 10070,
  "tags": [],
  "content": <content>,
  "sig": [<sig1>, <sig2>]
}
```

## Partially Signed Collaborative Event

A partially signed collaborative event can be published but in that case it must be replaced every time a new signature is added and therefore a partially signed collaborative event is identified by `KIND-10069`

## Partially Signed Example:

```json
{
  "id": <id>,
  "pubkey": [<pubkey1>, <pubkey2>],
  "created_at": <created_at>,
  "kind": 10069,
  "tags": [],
  "content": <content>,
  "sig": [<sig1>]
}
```

After a collaborative event is fully signed by the involved parties it can be published as replaceable or not according to the first 2 examples.
