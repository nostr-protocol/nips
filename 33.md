NIP-33
======

Parameterized Replaceable Events
--------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:Semisol`

This NIP adds a new event range that allows for replacement of events that have the same `d` tag and kind unlike NIP-16 which only replaced by kind.

Implementation
--------------
A *parameterized replaceable event* is defined as an event with a kind `30000 <= n < 40000`.
Upon a parameterized replaceable event with a newer timestamp than the currently known latest replaceable event with the same kind and `d` tag being received, the old event SHOULD be discarded and replaced with the newer event.  
A missing `d` tag should be interpreted as an empty tag value and only the first tag's value should be accounted for.

Client Behavior
---------------

Clients SHOULD use the `supported_nips` field to learn if a relay supports this NIP.  Clients MAY send parameterized replaceable events to relays that may not support this NIP, and clients querying SHOULD be prepared for the relay to send multiple events and should use the latest one and are recommended to send a `#d` tag filter.
