NIP-85
======

Specific Tag Replaceableability
-------------------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP establishes semantics similar to addressable events in the range `30000-39999`, but using different tags as the deduplication mechanism.

Events in the range `40000-43999` are deemed to be replaceable by another event that contains the same `author`, the same `kind` and a duplicated `e` tag.

Events in the range `44000-47999` are deemed to be replaceable by another event that contains the same `author`, the same `kind` and a duplicated `p` tag.

Events in the range `48000-49999` are deemed to be replaceable by another event that contains the same `author`, the same `kind` and a duplicated `a` tag.
