Reviews
-------

This NIP describes several different types of `review` which follow a single set of conventions.

In all cases, the `content` field SHOULD include a human-readable review. A review event's `d` tag indicates the object of the review.

# Ratings

Tags MAY contain additional `rating` tags each of which should have a `value` between 0 and 1,
and an optional `mark` specifying an attribute of the thing being reviewed.

# Review Kinds

Kind `31986` indicates a review of any event generated by a `pubkey`.
