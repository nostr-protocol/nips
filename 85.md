NIP-85
======

Trusted Assertions
------------------

`draft` `optional`

Certain calculations in Nostr require access to the entire dataset of events and are impossible to do directly by Clients. This NIP allows the creation of services that can perform such calculations and output signed events for each result continuously. Each calculation type receives a separate event kind. Users can set up which service providers they trust to perform these calculations so that Clients can load and display the results accordingly.

Assertions are always addressable events with the `d` tag pointing to the subject of the assertion. The following kinds and tags have been specified:

| name                 | kind  | `d` tag value | result tags                             | 
| -------------------- | ----- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Follower Count       | 30382 | target pubkey | `"followers"` (integer)                 | 
| WebOfTrust Score     | 30382 | target pubkey | `"wot"` (integer, normalized 0-100)     | 
| Zap Amount Received  | 30382 | target pubkey | `"zap_amt_recd"` (integer, millisats)   | 
| Zap Amount Sent      | 30382 | target pubkey | `"zap_amt_sent"` (integer, millisats)   | 
| Zap Number Received  | 30382 | target pubkey | `"zap_num_recd"` (integer, evt counter) | 
| Zap Number Sent      | 30382 | target pubkey | `"zap_num_sent"` (integer, evt counter) |
| Comment Count      | 30383 | target event id | `"comments"` (integer) |
| Repost Count      | 30383 | target event id | `"reposts"` (integer) |
| Reaction Count      | 30383 | target event id | `"reactions"` (integer) |
| Comment Count      | 30384 | target event address | `"comments"` (integer) |
| Repost Count      | 30384 | target event address | `"reposts"` (integer) |
| Reaction Count      | 30384 | target event address | `"reactions"` (integer) |

Example: 

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 30382,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "e88a691e98d9987c964521dff60025f60700378a4879180dcbbb4a5027850411"],
    ["wot", "89"],
    ["zap_amt_sent", "1000000"],
  ],
  "content": "",
  //...
}
```

Service providers SHOULD update their results constantly and MAY limit access by using paid relays.

## Declaring Trusted Service Providers

Kind `10040` lists the user's authorized providers for each service. The service tag is followed by the `pubkey` of the service and the relay where the results are published.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 10040,
  "tags": [
    ["wot", "818a39b5f164235f86254b12ca586efccc1f95e98b45cb1c91c71dc5d9486dda", "wss://relay.nostr.band"],
    ["wot", "3d842afecd5e293f28b6627933704a3fb8ce153aa91d790ab11f6a752d44a42d", "wss://nostr.wine"],
    ["zap_amt_sent", "818a39b5f164235f86254b12ca586efccc1f95e98b45cb1c91c71dc5d9486dda", "wss://relay.nostr.band"],
  ],
  "content": "",
  //...
}
```

Clients should download this list, and load and display assertions when appropriate.
