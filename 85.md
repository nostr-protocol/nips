Semantic Tuples
--------------

`draft` `optional` `author:staab`

A semantic tuple is a tag whose values are a tuple of `value`, `key`, and an optional `namespace`. This format is similar to NIP 32 labels, but are semantically different. While labels are values that can be applied to targets per se, triples are value/key doubles or value/key/namespace triples.

This NIP introduces two new tags which MAY be applied to any event:

- `v` is a value that relays should index
- `value` is a value that relays should not index

An event with `kind 1986` MAY be used if no other kind is appropriate.

In any given tuple:

- `value` can be any string. If the domain of values is large, the "value" tag SHOULD be used instead of the "v" tag so relays don't have to index values that won't be used in a filter.
- `key` can be any string. It MAY be a `label` as defined by NIP 32.
- `namespace` is optional, and can be any string. It MAY be a `namespace` as defined by NIP 32.

  ],
}
```

An RDF triple with NIP 32 labels for indexing.

```json
{
  "kind": 1986,
  "tags": [
    ["L", "http://example.name#JohnDoe34"],
    ["l", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows", "http://example.name#JohnDoe34"],
    ["v", "http://example.name#BobSmith12", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows", "http://example.name#JohnDoe34"]
