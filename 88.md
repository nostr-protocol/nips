Discreet Log Contracts over nostr
-----------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP describes a way to use Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) over Nostr. This comes in four main
components: `kind:8_888` for sending DLC messages between wallets. `kind:30088` for posting DLC offers to the global
market. `kind:88` and `kind:89` for publishing DLC oracle announcements and attestations. And `kind:90` for a DLC
"receipt" that can publish the result of a DLC for social interaction.

## DLC Messages

DLCs typically use [BOLT 8](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/08-transport.md) for sending messages but
this has various problems: it requires the ability to accept incoming connections and an always-on node. Nostr provides
a unique opportunity to use a different transport layer for DLCs. This NIP proposes a new `kind:8_888` message that
acts like a mailbox for DLC messages. The DLC messages are sent over nostr and available for the user the next time
they open their wallet. This allows for a more mobile-friendly DLC experience.

DLC protocol messages are binary-serialized messages described concretely in
[this document](https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs/blob/master/Messaging.md).
Whenever embedding DLC messages inside Nostr events (which are encoded as JSON), we serialize those DLC messages in base64.

### `kind:8_888`

Kind 8_888 is a simple message that contains a [NIP04](04.md) encrypted DLC message and is tagged with the recipient's
public key with a `p` tag and if it is in reply to another event, that event should be tagged with an `e` tag. The DLC
message is first serialized in binary, and then encrypted with [NIP04](04.md).

A DLC wallet should only process messages that are tagged with their public key and that are in reply to a message they
sent unless it is an offer. This is to prevent spam and to prevent a malicious actor from sending a message to a user
that looks like it is from a different user.

}
```

## DLC Offers

DLCs are done between two parties and Nostr provides a unique opportunity to create a global market for DLCs. This
market can be constructed with a simple list of DLC offers that can be filtered by the user's wallet. The user can then
select an offer and send a message to the offerer to begin the DLC process. `kind:30088` is an event that contains a DLC
offer.

A parameterized replaceable event is used to allow the offerer to update the offer or remove it from the market. The `d`
tag should be the Offer's id to allow replacement of the offer. If the user wishes to remove the offer from the market,
they can replace the event with an `expires` tag that is in the past. The `relays` tag indicates the relays on which to
contact the offerer.

The `content` field must be the base64-encoding of a binary-serialized
[`contract_info` object](https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs/blob/master/Messaging.md#the-contract_info-type).

### `kind:30_088`

}
```

## DLC Oracle Gossip

DLCs require an oracle to attest to the outcome of real world events. This is done by the oracle signing a message
containing the outcome of the event. Before they attest to the outcome, they must create an announcement where they
publish the intent to sign the future event. This announcement is then used by the DLC participants to create the
contract. Here we define two events, `kind:88` and `kind:89` that are used to publish the oracle's announcement and
attestations respectively.

### `kind:88`

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 88,
  "content": "base64 oracle_annoucement",
  "tags": [
    [
      "relays", // the relays the oracle will publish attestations to
      "wss://nostr.mutinywallet.com",
      "wss://relay.damus.io"
    ],
    [
      "title",
      "Optional Event Title"
    ],
    [
      "description",
      "An optional human-readable description of the event which the oracle will attest to, in plain text."
    ]
  ],
  "pubkey": "97c70a44366a6535c145b333f973ea86dfdc2d7a99da618c40c64705ad98e322",
  "created_at": 1679673265,
  "id": "30efed56a035b2549fcaeec0bf2c1595f9a9b3bb4b1a38abaf8ee9041c4b7d93",
  "sig": "f2cb581a84ed10e4dc84937bd98e27acac71ab057255f6aa8dfa561808c981fe8870f4a03c1e3666784d82a9c802d3704e174371aa13d63e2aeaf24ff5374d9d"
}
```

The `content` field must be the base64-encoding of a binary-serialized
[`oracle_annoucement` object](https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs/blob/master/Messaging.md#the-oracle_annoucement-type).

The optional `title` tag gives observers a short human-readable title with which to display the announcement in cards, hyperlinks, etc. It _should_ be at most 100 characters of UTF8 text. Clients _should_ ignore or truncate titles longer than 100 characters. This tag must NOT be parsed as markdown or HTML.

The optional `description` tag provides a human-readable summary of the real-world event which this announcement is for. The `description` should give observers context, so that they know how the real-world event in question will be reflected in the oracle's final attestation. This tag must NOT be parsed as markdown or HTML.

### `kind:89`

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 89,
  "content": "base64 oracle_attestation",
    "tags": [
    [
      "e", // the Nostr event id of the announcement
      "30efed56a035b2549fcaeec0bf2c1595f9a9b3bb4b1a38abaf8ee9041c4b7d93",
    ],
  ],
  "pubkey": "97c70a44366a6535c145b333f973ea86dfdc2d7a99da618c40c64705ad98e322",
  "created_at": 1679673265,
  "id": "30efed56a035b2549fcaeec0bf2c1595f9a9b3bb4b1a38abaf8ee9041c4b7d93",
  "sig": "f2cb581a84ed10e4dc84937bd98e27acac71ab057255f6aa8dfa561808c981fe8870f4a03c1e3666784d82a9c802d3704e174371aa13d63e2aeaf24ff5374d9d"
}
```

The `content` field must be the base64-encoding of a binary-serialized
[`oracle_attestation` object](https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs/blob/master/Messaging.md#the-oracle_attestation-type).

Note that the `e` tag is the _Nostr event identifier_ for the `kind:88` announcement event, which is distinct from the identifier
embedded [in the announcement](https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs/blob/master/Messaging.md#oracle_event) or
[in the attestation itself](https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs/blob/master/Messaging.md#oracle_attestation). The `e`
tag is intended to be used to look up the corresponding announcement event.

Upon receiving an attestation, clients _should_ validate that the `event_id` field inside the `oracle_announcement` object matches
the `event_id` field in the `oracle_attestation` object.

## DLC Receipts

DLCs can be fun, social events. This NIP proposes a `kind:90` event that can be used to publish the result of a DLC
contract. This event can be used to show off the result of a DLC to the user's followers, similar [Zaps](57.md) but for
DLC bets.

### `kind:90`

todo I still need to think about this one
