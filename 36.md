NIP-36
======

Sensitive Content / Content Warning
-----------------------------------

`draft` `optional`

The `content-warning` tag enables users to specify if the event's content needs to be approved by readers to be shown.
Clients can hide the content until the user acts on it.

For content utilizing the `content-warning` tag, it is recommended to use `kind 18` to appropriately categorize such events.
This recommendation is grounded in the fact that using the usual `kind 1` could lead to inappropriate display of sensitive
content by clients not compliant with NIP-36. By distinguishing with `kind 18`, it helps to avoid such confusion and ensures
better adherence to `content-warning` tag.

`l` and `L` tags MAY be also be used as defined in [NIP-32](32.md) with the `content-warning` or other namespace to support
further qualification and querying.

#### Spec
