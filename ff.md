NUDs
----

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines the creation of **NUD**s: _Nostr Unofficial Documents_, which are descriptions of standards and sub-standards that do not pertain to this NIPs repo.

Anyone can create a NUD and they are immediatelly valid as soon as they are published. NUDs have owners and can be modified by these owners at any time, but they can also be forked or reinterpreted by others.

NUDs MUST declare the event kinds they use and then those kind reservations SHOULD be taken into account in the NIPs big table of known kinds, with a link to the NUD.

Multiple forks of a NUD can exist at the same time -- although eventually it's natural that one of them becomes the _de facto_ winner. The NIPs repo SHOULD make reasonable judgements about which is which when considering what NUD to add to its big table (it's also ok to have multiple forks added, if there aren't clear winners).

The NIPs repo SHOULD make reasonable judgements about what NUDs to actually add to the big table in the first place, as some may not meet basic decency criteria or may not be used at all, so they SHOULD NOT be added, or they SHOULD be removed later if the assumptions change.
