Nutzaps
-------

`draft` `optional`

A Nutzap is an event containing a [P2PK-locked](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/11.md) Cashu token that is publicly verifiable.

## High-level flow
Alice wants to nutzap 1 sat to Bob for an event `nutzapped-event-id` she liked.

### Alice nutzaps Bob
1. Alice fetches event `kind:10019` from Bob to see the mints Bob trusts.
2. She mints or swaps ecash at that mint with a P2PK lock that contains the pubkey Bob listed in his `kind:10019`, a `P` tag with the sender's pubkey, and an `e` tag of the event `nutzapped-event-id` to zap.
3. She publishes a `kind:9321` event to the relays Bob indicated with the proofs she minted.

### Bob receives the nutzap
1. At some point, Bob's client fetches `kind:9321` events p-tagging him from his relays.
2. Bob's client swaps the token into his wallet.

## Nutzap informational event
```jsonc
{
    "kind": 10019,
    "tags": [
        [ "relay", "wss://relay1" ],
        [ "relay", "wss://relay2" ],
        [ "mint", "https://mint1", "usd", "sat" ],
        [ "mint", "https://mint2", "sat" ],
        [ "pubkey", "<p2pk-pubkey>" ]
    ]
}
```

* `kind:10019` is an event that is useful for others to know how to send money to the user.
* `relay`: relays where the user will be reading token events from. If a user wants to send money to the user, they should write to these relays.
* `mint`: mints the user is explicitly agreeing to use to receive funds on. Clients SHOULD not send money on mints not listed here or risk burning their money. Additional markers can be used to list the supported base units of the mint.
* `pubkey`: Public key that MUST be used to P2PK-lock receiving nutzaps -- implementations MUST NOT use the target user's main Nostr public key. This public key corresponds to the `privkey` field encrypted in a user's [nip-60](60.md) _wallet event_.

### Nutzap event
Event `kind:9321` is a nutzap event published by the sender, p-tagging the recipient. The outputs are P2PK-locked to the public key the recipient indicated in their `kind:10019` event and with a P2PK secret that commits to the event id `nutzapped-event-id` to zap.

##### Cashu proof
A NIP-61 zap contains one or more Cashu proofs with a [NUT-12](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/11.md) P2PK lock. The proof's `secret` has the receiver's `p2pk-pubkey` in `data` field. The `tags` field of the `secret` contains a `P` tag with the sender's pubkey `sender-pubkey` and the zapped event's id `e`. The proof also contains a [NUT-12](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/12.md) DLEQ field `dleq`.

Clients MUST prefix the receiver's `p2pk-pubkey` with `"02"` (for nostr<>cashu compatibility).
```jsonc
{
  "amount":2,
  "C":"0302f4aacbfa5da455b884501ebcbd4c9c3cc6640daa7269f640aa70522727b790",
  "id":"00da2cc2b0016589",
  "secret":"[\"P2PK\", {\"data\": \"029128d0918cd2241e92968c2d5f8eb6ba9b6adf3cd7bd0a5c82c64400470f9a86\", \"nonce\": \"43e0d7c14e20616850f540b5dec96006\", \"tags\": [[\"e\", \"nutzapped-event-id\"], [\"P\", \"sender-pubkey\"]]}]",
  "dleq":{
      "r":"e5f0c29513ef7e0b0b1798be8f7ca7940296833a7e723e16ba2162299c77d183",
      "s":"12fdde66b4bc26fc76f11f88aae527fb1642c0fb4066d06db8a3c6976a224205",
      "e":"9df01b6421926fd04521185d3264eed99a4c0951d8c247f0f8f1244d340d5e06"
  }
}
```

##### Nostr event

The nutzap event contains one or more serialized Cashu proofs.

```jsonc
{
    "kind": 9321,
    "content": "Thanks for this great idea.",
    "pubkey": "<sender-pubkey>",
    "tags": [
        [ "proof", "{\"amount\": 2, \"C\": \"0302f4aacbfa5da455b884501ebcbd4c9c3cc6640daa7269f640aa70522727b790\", \"id\": \"00da2cc2b0016589\", \"secret\": \"[\\\"P2PK\\\", {\\\"data\\\": \\\"029128d0918cd2241e92968c2d5f8eb6ba9b6adf3cd7bd0a5c82c64400470f9a86\\\", \\\"nonce\\\": \\\"43e0d7c14e20616850f540b5dec96006\\\", \\\"tags\\\": [[\\\"e\\\", \\\"nutzapped-event-id\\\"], [\\\"P\\\", \\\"sender-pubkey\\\"]]}]\", \"dleq\": {\"r\": \"e5f0c29513ef7e0b0b1798be8f7ca7940296833a7e723e16ba2162299c77d183\", \"s\": \"12fdde66b4bc26fc76f11f88aae527fb1642c0fb4066d06db8a3c6976a224205\", \"e\": \"9df01b6421926fd04521185d3264eed99a4c0951d8c247f0f8f1244d340d5e06\"}}"],
        [ "unit", "sat" ],
        [ "u", "https://stablenut.umint.cash" ],
        [ "e", "<nutzapped-event-id>", "<relay-hint>" ],
        [ "k", "<nutzapped-kind>"],
        [ "p", "e9fbced3a42dcf551486650cc752ab354347dd413b307484e4fd1818ab53f991" ], // recipient of nutzap
    ]
}
```

* `.content` is an optional comment for the nutzap
* `.tags`:
  * `proof` is one P2PK-locked proof to the public key the recipient specified in their `kind:10019` event, a `P` tag committing to the sender's pubkey `sender-pubkey`, an optional `e` tag committing to `nutzapped-event-id`, and a DLEQ proof. Multiple `proof` tags may be added - one proof per tag.
  * `unit` the base unit the proofs are denominated in (eg: `sat`, `usd`, `eur`). Default: `sat` if omitted.
  * `u` is the mint the URL of the mint EXACTLY as specified by the recipient's `kind:10019`.
  * `p` is the Nostr identity public key of nutzap recipient.
  * `e` is the event that is being nutzapped, if any.

Note that the optional `e` tag is contained in the Cashu proof's `secret` as well as in the Nostr event. The `P` tag in the Cashu proof is the `pubkey` in the nutzap event.

## Sending a nutzap

* The sender fetches the recipient's `kind:10019`.
* The sender mints/swaps ecash on one of the recipient's listed mints.
* The sender P2PK-locks to the recipient's specified public key in their `kind:10019`

## Receiving nutzaps

Clients should REQ for nutzaps:
* Filtering with `#u` for mints they expect to receive ecash from.
  * this is to prevent even interacting with mints the user hasn't explicitly signaled.
* Filtering with `since` of the most recent `kind:7376` event the same user has created.
  * this can be used as a marker of the nutzaps that have already been swapped by the user -- clients might choose to use other kinds of markers, including internal state -- this is just a guidance of one possible approach.

`{ "kinds": [9321], "#p": ["my-pubkey"], "#u": ["<mint-1>", "<mint-2>"], "since": <latest-created_at-of-kind-7376> }`.

Upon receiving a new nutzap, the client should swap the tokens into a wallet the user controls, either a [NIP-60](60.md) wallet, their own LN wallet or anything else.

### Updating nutzap-redemption history
When claiming a token the client SHOULD create a `kind:7376` event and `e` tag the original nutzap event. This is to record that this token has already been claimed (and shouldn't be attempted again) and as signaling to the recipient that the ecash has been redeemed.

Multiple `kind:9321` events can be tagged in the same `kind:7376` event.

```jsonc
{
    "kind": 7376,
    "content": nip44_encrypt([
        [ "direction", "in" ], // in = received, out = sent
        [ "amount", "1" ],
        [ "unit", "sat" ],
        [ "e", "<7375-event-id>", "<relay-hint>", "created" ] // new token event that was created
    ]),
    "tags": [
        [ "e", "<9321-event-id>", "<relay-hint>", "redeemed" ], // nutzap event that has been redeemed
        [ "p", "<sender-pubkey>" ] // pubkey of the author of the 9321 event (nutzap sender)
    ]
}
```

Events that redeem a nutzap SHOULD be published to the sender's [NIP-65](65.md) "read" relays.

### Verifying a Cashu Zap
When listing or counting zaps received by any given event, observer clients SHOULD:

* check that the receiving user has issued a `kind:10019` tagging the mint where the cashu has been minted.
* check that the Cashu proofs are locked to the pubkey the user has listed in their `kind:10019`.
* check that the Cashu proof's secret contains a `P` that equals the `pubkey` of the nutzap event.
* check that the Cashu proofs' secrets contain an `e` tag that equals the zapped event's id.
* look at the `u` tag and check that the token is issued in one of the mints listed in the `kind:10019`.
* verify the DLEQs of the proofs using the public keysets of the mint.

All these checks can be done offline (as long as the observer has the receiver mints' keyset and their `kind:10019` event), so the process should be reasonably fast.

### Final Considerations
1. Clients SHOULD guide their users to use NUT-11 (P2PK) and NUT-12 (DLEQ proofs) compatible-mints in their `kind:10019` event to avoid receiving nutzaps anyone can spend.
2. Clients SHOULD normalize and deduplicate mint URLs as described in NIP-65.
3. A nutzap event MUST include proofs in one of the mints the recipient has listed in their `kind:10019` and published to the NIP-65 relays of the recipient, failure to do so may result in the recipient donating the tokens to the mint since the recipient might never see the event.
