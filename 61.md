Event Set
---------

`draft` `optional`

An event set is represented by a group of events, not a single event.
Each event of a specific set has the same pubkey and `n` (set "n"ame) tag.

An event can have many `n` tags, thus being member of many event sets.
To remove an event from a set, remove the corresponding `n` tag from the event or
send a deletion event (`kind:5`).

## Referencing

An event set is referenced by an `s` tag. It
references many events from an author instead of a single one:

`["s", "<kind>:<pubkey>:<n-tag>", "<recommended-relay-URL, optional>"]`

One may also use an `nset` [NIP-19](19.md) entity through a [NIP-21](21.md) URI: `nostr:nset1qqstn...794234d`.

## How to add items to a set

Just add an `n` tag to your event. For example, adding one of your long-form posts to a set named "a-set-name-example":

```js
{
  "kind": 30023,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<random>"],
    ["n", "a-set-name-example"]
    // other tags
  ]
  // other fields
}
```

## Tagging into Event Sets

You SHOULD use a list of pre-defined event kinds to tag existing events, public keys, or other references into sets.

The kind and `d` tag value will vary depending on the type of item being referenced.

**Some** of the event kinds **require** a `k` tag set to the referenced item kind to help with filtering or other tags.

**Table of "Set Item Reference" Event Kinds and Structure by Referenced Item Type**:

| Type | Kind | d-tag | other required tags |
|-|-|-|-|
| **pubkey** | 30382 | `<user-pubkey>` | |
| **event** | 30383 | `<event-id>` | `["k", "<event-kind>"]`, `["p", "<event-pubkey>"]` |
| **(parameterized) replaceable event** | 30384 | `<event-kind>:<event-pubkey>:<event-d-tag>` | `["k", "<event-kind>"]` |
| **hashtag** | 30385 | `<t-tag>` | |
| **url** | 30386 | `<url-with-protocol-without-trailing-slash>` | |
| **relay** | 30387 | `<relay-url-with-protocol-without-trailing-slash>` | |
| **emoji** | 30388 | `<emoji-image-url-with-protocol-without-trailing-slash>`) | `["emoji", "<shortcode>"]` |
| **word** | 30389 | `<lowercase-string>` | |

These events may have tags other than `n` with extra metadata about the referenced item.
Because of that, when removing some metadata during an edit, clients should only delete the event when all tags other
than the `d` one were removed and the content is an empty string.

Example of 1 item (a pubkey) that is simultaneously part of 3 event sets:

```js
{
  "kind": 30382,
  "pubkey": "<me>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<another-user-pubkey>"],
    ["n", "follow"],
    ["n", "friend"],
    ["n", "Best Friends Forever"]
    // ...other metadata
  ],
  // ...empty string or secret metadata
  "content": nip44Encrypt(JSON.stringify([
    ["petname", "Zygote"],
    ["summary", "Owes me a beer"],
    // ...other secret metadata
  ])),
  // ...other fields
}
```

### Private "Set Item Reference" Event:

What makes such events private is the process of obfuscating the `d` tag value and adding the clear version of it
inside the encrypted `.content`.

To obfuscate a value, it is deterministically hashed by generating an auxiliary private key
with the [NIP-44](44.md) HKDF function and salt set to "nip61", concatenating it with the to-be-obfuscated value,
hashing the result with SHA256, then encoding it to hex.

**Table of Private "Set Item Reference" Event Kinds and Structure by Referenced Item Type**: Note that `obfuscate(<value>)`
is representing the step taken to hash the `d` tag value explained above.

| Type | Kind | d-tag | other required tags |
|-|-|-|-|
| **pubkey** (private) | 31382 | obfuscate(`<user-pubkey>`) | |
| **event** (private) | 31383 | obfuscate(`<event-id>`) | `["k", "<event-kind>"]`, `["p", obfuscate("<event-pubkey>")]` |
| **(parameterized) replaceable event** (private) | 31384 | obfuscate(`<event-kind>:<event-pubkey>:<event-d-tag>`) | `["k", "<event-kind>"]` |
| **hashtag** (private) | 31385 | obfuscate(`<t-tag>`) | |
| **url** (private) | 31386 | obfuscate(`<url-with-protocol-without-trailing-slash>`) | |
| **relay** (private) | 31387 | obfuscate(`<relay-url-with-protocol-without-trailing-slash>` | |
| **emoji** (private) | 31388 | obfuscate(`<emoji-image-url-with-protocol-without-trailing-slash>`) | `["emoji", "<shortcode>"]` |
| **word** (private) | 31389 | obfuscate(`<lowercase-string>`) | |

Example event:

```js
{
  "kind": 31382,
  "pubkey": "<me>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", toHex(sha256(hkdf("<my-private-key>", salt: "nip61") || "<another-user-pubkey>"))]
    ["n", "example-set-name"]
  ],
  "content": nip44Encrypt(JSON.stringify([
    ["d", "<another-user-pubkey>"]
    // ...other secret metadata
  ])),
  // ...other fields
}
```

## Set Names

There are two types of sets: those with a "standard" name and those with a "custom" one (most likely user-generated name).

### Standard

Standard sets have one of the names (the `n` tag value) listed here to guarantee interoperability.
The convention is to prefer lowercase English words in singular form with dash separator.

| n-tag | description |
|-|-|
| bookmark | list of things a user wants to save |
| contact | pubkeys to whom the user sent DMs or started an interaction such as an one-on-one audio/video call |
| file | adds events and files (urls) to a root directory similar to "/" |
| follow | followed pubkeys, hashtags, etc |
| friend | friends' pubkeys |
| mute | pubkeys, hashtags, words or notes the user doesn't want to see in their feeds and blocked relays |
| notification | notes monitored for new replies, zaps and reactions |
| pin | events to showcase in the user profile page |
| upload | files (urls) - requires `m` tag set to the MIME type |

### Custom

To **keep track of the custom set names**, the encrypted parameterized replaceable "Custom Sets" `kind:30061` event is used.

Such event with `d-tag=""` lists custom set names with no expected special treatment by clients
(these sets effectively work like labels).

However, adding a **standard** set name to the `d` tag instructs clients to treat the listed custom sets the same as they treat
the corresponding **standard** set. For example, sets listed within a `kind:30061` with `d-tag="follow"` are treated
by clients the same way as the "follow" set, i.e., they could be used as custom feeds.

A `kind:30061` event has one `map` tag for each custom set. A `map` tag has the first value as the custom set name.
When the user doesn't want to reveal the real custom set name, the `map` tag's first value can be a fake or random string
that maps to the `map` tag's second value, which holds the real custom set name that just the user will see.

Examples:

```js
{
  "kind": 30061,
  "tags": [
    ["d", ""]
  ]
  "content": nip44Encrypt(JSON.stringify([
    ["map", "<public-name>", "<real-name>"],
    ["map", "Good Fellow", "Good Fellow"],
    ["map", "6064460175057025", "Debtor"]
  ])),
  // ...other fields
}
```

```js
{
  "kind": 30061,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "file"]
  ]
  "content": nip44Encrypt(JSON.stringify([
    ["map", "4234649720408324", "/sub/directory"],
    ["map", "/home", "/home"]
  ]))
  // other fields
}
```
