Badges
------

`draft` `optional` `author:cameri`

A special event meaning "Badge" is defined as an event with kind `8` having a list of `p` tags,
one for each pubkey the author (issuer) wishes to award. A parameterized replaceable event meaning "Profile Badges" is defined as an event with kind `30008` with a `d` tag identifier equal to `profile_badges` and having an ordered list of `e` tags, one for each badge the user wishes to show on their profile. Badges as immutable events are non-transferrable.

### Badge event

A Badge's `content` field is a JSON-stringified object containing the fields `short_desc`, `image`, `thumbs` and optionally `long_desc`. In the case where `long_desc` is omitted, it is treated the same equal to `short_desc`.

The `short_desc` and `long_desc` fields are strings that may contain the meaning behind the badge and/or
the reason of it's issuance.

The `image` field is the URL of a high-resolution image representing the badge.

The `thumbs` field is an object containing thumbnail versions of the image referenced in the `image` field. The format of the keys are the dimensions `width`x`height` in pixels and the value is an URL pointing to respective thumbnail image.

### Profile Badges Event

The number of badges a pubkey can receive is unbounded. The Profile Badge event allows individual users to choose
the badges (and order) to show on their profiles.

The content is not used and SHOULD be blank.

The `e` tags in the Profile Badge event MUST reference kind `8` events containing a `p` tag that matches that of the Profile Badge. Badges that don't meet this criteria MUST be ignored.

### Motivation

Users MAY be awarded badges in recognition, in gratitude, for participation, or in appreciation of a certain goal, task or cause.

Users MAY choose to decorate their profiles with badges for fame, notoriety, recognition, support, etc., from badge issuers they deem reputable.

### Recommendations

Badge issuers MAY include some Proof of Work as per [NIP-13](13.md) when minting badges to embed them with an energy cost, arguably making them more special and valuable for users that wish to collect them.

Clients MAY whitelist badge issuers (pubkeys) for the purpose of ensuring they retain a valuable/special factor for their users.

Badge image recommended aspect ratio is 1:1 with a high-res size of 1024x1024 pixels.

Badge thumbnail image recommended sizes are: 512x512 (xl), 256x256 (l), 64x64 (m), 32x32 (s) and 16x16 (xs).

Clients SHOULD render the most appropriate badge thumbnail according to the number of badges chosen by the user and space available. Clients SHOULD render the high-res version on user action (click, tap, hover).

### Example of Badge Event

{
  "id": "<charlie's issued badge event id>",
