NIP-1129 (Arbiter Profile)
======

Arbiter Profile
-----------------------------

`draft` `optional`

## Abstract

This NIP defines a profile for arbiter users on the Nostr network. Arbiters are neutral third parties responsible for resolving disputes between buyers and sellers in peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces when trades encounter problems.

When disputes arise in [NIP-69](69.md) order events, both parties may need an arbiter to review evidence and make fair judgments. This NIP enables arbiters to publish their profiles, making them discoverable by P2P platforms and users who need dispute resolution services. The profile includes the arbiter's fee structure, supported currencies, payment methods, and reviews from past arbitrations.

## The profile

The profile is a [NIP-39](39.md) profile, and it looks like this:
