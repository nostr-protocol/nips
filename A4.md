Public Messages
---------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines kind `24` as a simple plaintext message to one or more Nostr users. 

The `.content` contains the message. `p` tags identify one or more receivers.

```jsonc
{
  "pubkey": "<sender-pubkey>",
  "kind": 24,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<receiver>", "<relay-url>"],
  ],
  "content": "<message-in-plain-text>",
}
```

Messages MUST be sent to the [NIP-65](65.md) inbox relays of each receiver and the outbox relay of the sender.

Kind `24` is designed to be shown and replied to from notification screens. The goal is to allow clients to 
support this feature without having to worry about chat history. There are no message chains. The concept of a 
"thread", a "thread root", or a "chatroom" does not exist in this system, as messages can start and continue 
without any syntactic connection to each other. `e` tags must not be used.

This kind is not designed to be displayed on feeds, but anyone can see and reply to messages that may not be for them.

## Advanced Support

[NIP-40](40.md) `expiration` tags are recommended. Since there is no concept of a chatroom, it is unlikely that these messages will 
make sense as time goes on.

[NIP-18](18.md) quote repost `q` tags MAY be used when citing events in the `.content` with [NIP-21](21.md).

```json
["q", "<event-id> or <event-address>", "<relay-url>", "<pubkey-if-a-regular-event>"]
```

[NIP-25](25.md) reactions MUST add a `k` tag to `24`. 

[NIP-57](57.md) zaps MUST include the `k` tag to `24`

[NIP-21](21.md) links that use [NIP-19](19.md)'s `nevent1` MUST include a `kind` of `24`. Links that are not `kind:24` are not expected to be rendered natively by the client.

[NIP-92](92.md) `imeta` tags SHOULD be added for image and video links.

## Warnings

There MUST be no expectation of privacy in this kind. It is just a public reply, but without a root note.

Avoid confusing this kind with Kind `14` rumors in [NIP-17](17.md) DMs. This kind is signed and designed for public consumption.
