NIP-47
======

Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC)
--------------------

`draft` `optional`

## Rationale

This NIP describes a way for clients to access a remote lightning wallet through a standardized protocol. Custodians may implement this, or the user may run a bridge that bridges their wallet/node and the Nostr Wallet Connect protocol.

## Terms

* **client**: Nostr app on any platform that wants to interact with a lightning wallet.
* **user**: The person using the **client**, and wants to connect their wallet to their **client**.
* **wallet service**: Nostr app that typically runs on an always-on computer (eg. in the cloud or on a Raspberry Pi).  This app has access to the APIs of the wallets it serves.

## Theory of Operation

Fundamentally NWC is communication between a **client** and **wallet service** by the means of E2E-encrypted direct messages over a nostr relay. The relay knows the kinds and tags of notes, but not the content of the encrypted payloads. The **user**'s identity key is not used to avoid linking payment activity to the user. Ideally unique keys are used for each individual connection.

 1. **Users** who wish to use this NIP to allow **client(s)** to interact with their wallet must first acquire a special "connection" URI from their NIP-47 compliant wallet application.  The wallet application may provide this URI using a QR screen, or a pasteable string, or some other means. 
 
 2. The **user** should then copy this URI into their **client(s)** by pasting, or scanning the QR, etc.  The **client(s)** should save this URI and use it later whenever the **user** (or the **client** on the user's behalf) wants to interact with the wallet.  The **client** should then request an `info` (13194) event from the relay(s) specified in the URI.  The **wallet service** will have sent that event to those relays earlier, and the relays will hold it as a replaceable event.  
 
 3. When the **user** initiates a payment their nostr **client** create a `pay_invoice` request, encrypts it using a token from the URI, and sends it (kind 23194) to the relay(s) specified in the connection URI.  The **wallet service** will be listening on those relays and will decrypt the request and then contact the **user's** wallet application to send the payment.  The **wallet service** will know how to talk to the wallet application because the connection URI specified relay(s) that have access to the wallet app API.  
 
 4. Once the payment is complete the **wallet service** will send an encrypted `response` (kind 23195) to the **user** over the relay(s) in the URI.
 
 5. The **wallet service** may send encrypted notifications (kind 23196) of wallet events (such as a received payment) to the **client**.

## Events

There are four event kinds:
- `NIP-47 info event`: 13194
- `NIP-47 request`: 23194
- `NIP-47 response`: 23195
- `NIP-47 notification event`: 23196

### Info Event

The info event should be a replaceable event that is published by the **wallet service** on the relay to indicate which capabilities it supports.

The content should be a plaintext string with the supported capabilities space-separated, eg. `pay_invoice get_balance notifications`.

If the **wallet service** supports notifications, the info event SHOULD contain a `notifications` tag with the supported notification types space-separated, eg. `payment_received payment_sent`.

### Request and Response Events

Both the request and response events SHOULD contain one `p` tag, containing the public key of the **wallet service** if this is a request, and the public key of the **client** if this is a response. The response event SHOULD contain an `e` tag with the id of the request event it is responding to.
Optionally, a request can have an `expiration` tag that has a unix timestamp in seconds. If the request is received after this timestamp, it should be ignored.

The content of requests and responses is encrypted with [NIP04](04.md), and is a JSON-RPCish object with a semi-fixed structure:

Request:
```jsonc
{
    "method": "pay_invoice", // method, string
    "params": { // params, object
        "invoice": "lnbc50n1..." // command-related data
    }
}
```

Response:
```jsonc
{
    "result_type": "pay_invoice", //indicates the structure of the result field
    "error": { //object, non-null in case of error
        "code": "UNAUTHORIZED", //string error code, see below
        "message": "human readable error message"
    },
    "result": { // result, object. null in case of error.
        "preimage": "0123456789abcdef..." // command-related data
    }
}
```

The `result_type` field MUST contain the name of the method that this event is responding to.
The `error` field MUST contain a `message` field with a human readable error message and a `code` field with the error code if the command was not successful.
If the command was successful, the `error` field must be null.

### Notification Events

The notification event SHOULD contain one `p` tag, the public key of the **client**.

The content of notifications is encrypted with [NIP04](04.md), and is a JSON-RPCish object with a semi-fixed structure:

```jsonc
{
    "notification_type": "payment_received", //indicates the structure of the notification field
    "notification": {
        "payment_hash": "0123456789abcdef..." // notification-related data
    }
}
```


### Error codes
- `RATE_LIMITED`: The client is sending commands too fast. It should retry in a few seconds.
- `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`: The command is not known or is intentionally not implemented.
- `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`: The wallet does not have enough funds to cover a fee reserve or the payment amount.
- `QUOTA_EXCEEDED`: The wallet has exceeded its spending quota.
- `RESTRICTED`: This public key is not allowed to do this operation.
- `UNAUTHORIZED`: This public key has no wallet connected.
- `INTERNAL`: An internal error.
- `OTHER`: Other error.

## Nostr Wallet Connect URI

Communication between the **client** and **wallet service** requires two keys in order to encrypt and decrypt messages. The connection URI includes the secret key of the **client** and only the public key of the **wallet service**.

> This is the original flow for initiating a NWC connection, however is less secure and prone to user error as the secret must be copy-pasted into the **client** to initiate the connection. Please see the client-created secret flows below as an alternative.

The **client** discovers **wallet service** by scanning a QR code, handling a deeplink or pasting in a URI.

The **wallet service** generates this connection URI with protocol `nostr+walletconnect://` and base path its 32-byte hex-encoded `pubkey`, which SHOULD be unique per client connection.

The connection URI contains the following query string parameters:

- `relay` Required. URL of the relay where the **wallet service** is connected and will be listening for events. May be more than one.
- `secret` Required. 32-byte randomly generated hex encoded string. The **client** MUST use this to sign events and encrypt payloads when communicating with the **wallet service**. The **wallet service** MUST use the corresponding public key of this secret to communicate with the **client**.
    - Authorization does not require passing keys back and forth.
    - The user can have different keys for different applications. Keys can be revoked and created at will and have arbitrary constraints (eg. budgets).
    - The key is harder to leak since it is not shown to the user and backed up.
    - It improves privacy because the user's main key would not be linked to their payments.
- `lud16` Recommended. A lightning address that clients can use to automatically setup the `lud16` field on the user's profile if they have none configured.

The **client** should then store this connection and use it when the user wants to perform actions like paying an invoice. Due to this NIP using ephemeral events, it is recommended to pick relays that do not close connections on inactivity to not drop events, and ideally retain the events until they are either consumed or become stale.

- When the **client** sends or receives a message it will use the `secret` from the connection URI and **wallet service**'s `pubkey` to encrypt or decrypt.
- When the **wallet service** sends or receives a message it will use its own secret and the corresponding pubkey of the **client's** `secret` to encrypt or decrypt. The **wallet service** SHOULD NOT store the secret it generates for the client and MUST NOT rely on the knowing the **client** secret for general operation.

### Example connection string
```sh
nostr+walletconnect://b889ff5b1513b641e2a139f661a661364979c5beee91842f8f0ef42ab558e9d4?relay=wss%3A%2F%2Frelay.damus.io&secret=71a8c14c1407c113601079c4302dab36460f0ccd0ad506f1f2dc73b5100e4f3c
```

## Client-Created Secret

The client MAY generate its own secret and co-ordinate only public keys with the wallet service so that secrets are never exposed.

### HTTP Confirmation Page

A **wallet service** MAY host a publicly accessible confirmation page that the **client** may open (e.g. in a webview or popup window) and allow the **user** to confirm the creation of a new connection, with the following parameters:

- `pubkey` Required. The corresponding pubkey of the secret generated by the **client**.

The **wallet service** MAY ignore all the below optional parameters.

- `name`: Optional. The name of the client app.
- `icon`: Optional. The URL of an icon of the client app to display on the confirmation page.
- `return_to` Optional. URI to open after the connection is created. The **wallet service** SHOULD add the `relay_url`, `wallet_pubkey` and `lud16` parameters to the URI.
- `expires_at` Optional. The connection cannot be used after this date. Unix timestamp in seconds.
- `max_amount` Optional. The maximum amount in millisats that can be sent per renewal period
- `budget_renewal` Optional. The reset the budget at the end of the given budget renewal. Can be `never` (default), `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`
- `request_methods` Optional. The url encoded, space separated list of request types that you need permission for. For example: `..&request_methods=pay_invoice%20get_balance`
- `notification_types` Optional. The url encoded, space separated list of notification types that you need permission for. For example: `..&notification_types=payment_received%20payment_sent`
- `isolated` Optional. The makes an isolated app connection / sub-wallet with its own balance and only access to its own transaction list. e.g. `&isolated=true`.
- `metadata` Optional. Url encoded, JSON-serialized metadata that describes the app connection.

The **user** MUST be presented with a confirmation page to be able to review and approve or decline the connection.

If the **user** approves the request, a new connection should be created for **client**'s public key (specified in the `pubkey` parameter).

#### Communicating the wallet pubkey and relay to the client via popup/webview

The confirmation page MAY dispatch an event and post a message to the window and window opener (if present) so that the **client** can discover the pubkey and preferred relay url of the **wallet service**.

```javascript
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("nwc:success", {
    detail: {
        relayUrl,
        walletPubkey,
        lud16, // optional
    },
}));

window.opener?.postMessage({
    type: "nwc:success",
    relayUrl,
    walletPubkey,
    lud16, // optional
}, "*");
```

At this point, both the **client** and **wallet service** have all information required to communicate over NWC.

#### Example HTTP confirmation URL

`https://example.com/connections/new?pubkey=b889ff5b1513b641e2a139f661a661364979c5beee91842f8f0ef42ab558e9d4`

### Nostr Flow

The **client** MAY generate an authorization URI with protocol `nostr+walletauth://` and base path its hex-encoded `pubkey` with the following query string parameters:

- `relay` Required. URL of the relay where the **client** intends to communicate with the **wallet service**. May be more than one.

The **wallet service** MAY ignore all the below optional parameters.

- `name`: Optional. The name of the client app.
- `icon`: Optional. The URL of an icon of the client app to display on the confirmation page.
- `return_to` Optional. URI to open after the connection is created.
- `expires_at` Optional. The connection cannot be used after this date. Unix timestamp in seconds.
- `max_amount` Optional. The maximum amount in millisats that can be sent per renewal period
- `budget_renewal` Optional. The reset the budget at the end of the given budget renewal. Can be `never` (default), `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`
- `request_methods` Optional. The url encoded, space separated list of request types that you need permission for. For example: `..&request_methods=pay_invoice%20get_balance`
- `notification_types` Optional. The url encoded, space separated list of notification types that you need permission for. For example: `..&notification_types=payment_received%20payment_sent`
- `isolated` Optional. The makes an isolated app connection / sub-wallet with its own balance and only access to its own transaction list. e.g. `&isolated=true`.
- `metadata` Optional. Url encoded, JSON-serialized metadata that describes the app connection.

The **user** opens the URL in the **wallet service** by scanning a QR code, handling a deeplink or pasting in a URI, and MUST be presented with a confirmation page.

If the **user** approves the request, a new connection should be created for the **client**'s public key (specified in the base path of the authorization URI). Once the connection is created, the NIP-47 info event MUST be broadcasted to the relays specified in the authorization URI, and the info event MUST include a `p` tag containing the public key of the **client** this info is for, so that the **client** can discover the public key of the **wallet service**. The `p` tag MAY contain the recommended relay url of the **wallet service**.

The **client** is then able to subscribe to the NIP-47 info event (kind 13194) filtered by setting the `p` tag to the pubkey of the **client**. The **client** will then know the public key of the **wallet service** (as the publisher of the info event).

At this point, both the **client** and **wallet service** have all information required to communicate over NWC.

The `lud16` field cannot be immediately communicated via the NIP-47 event to avoid metadata leaks. To discover the lightning address, the **client** MAY look for the presence of the  `lud16` parameter in the `get_info` response.

#### Example Authorization URI

`nostr+walletauth://b889ff5b1513b641e2a139f661a661364979c5beee91842f8f0ef42ab558e9d4?relay=wss%3A%2F%2Frelay.example.com%2Fv1`

To target a specific wallet, a `nostr+walletauth+walletname` scheme may be used.

## Example pay invoice flow

0. The user scans the QR code generated by the **wallet service** with their **client** application, they follow a `nostr+walletconnect://` deeplink or configure the connection details manually.
1. **client** sends an event to the **wallet service** with kind `23194`. The content is a `pay_invoice` request. The private key is the secret from the connection string above.
2. **wallet service** verifies that the author's key is authorized to perform the payment, decrypts the payload and sends the payment.
3. **wallet service** responds to the event by sending an event with kind `23195` and content being a response either containing an error message or a preimage.

## Using a dedicated relay
This NIP does not specify any requirements on the type of relays used. However, if the user is using a custodial service it might make sense to use a relay that is hosted by the custodial service. The relay may then enforce authentication to prevent metadata leaks. Not depending on a 3rd party relay would also improve reliability in this case.
