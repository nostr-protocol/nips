# Accessibility (A11y)
----------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:fernandolguevara`

## Abstract

Accessibility involves designing content, products, services, and environments to be usable and accessible by users with disabilities. This NIP proposes a mechanism for users with disabilities to define their accessibility preferences using `kind: 0` event type. This way, NOSTR Clients can enhance the inclusive experience for all users.

## Categories of disabilities

To address diverse accessibility needs, disabilities can be categorized into:

- Visual
- Hearing
- Physical
- Cognitive, Learning, and Neurological
- Speech

Example
-------

```json
{
	"kind": 0,
	"tags": [
		["a11y", "visual", "hearing", "physical", "..."],
// TODO: We need consensus on categorization and nomination of accessibility markers
		["a11y-visual", "contrast sensitivity", "red color blindness"],
		["a11y-visual-color-blindness", "red"]
	]
	...
}
```

Implementing this proposal could benefit a range of scenarios:

1. **Adaptive UI**: Clients can dynamically adjust their user interfaces based on the provided accessibility preferences, ensuring optimal interaction for users with disabilities.
2. **Content Customization**: Content can be presented in formats that suit users' preferences, such as providing subtitles for videos or larger fonts for visually impaired users.
3. **Navigation**: Users with physical disabilities can set preferences for navigation methods that best suit their abilities, whether via keyboard shortcuts or voice commands.
