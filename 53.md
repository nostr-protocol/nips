## Name:

Nostr Domain System (NDS)

Kind 10000

## Description:

A nostr-based decentralized domain registration system where any user can publish an event where IP or onion addresses are assigned to a domain name, multiple domains can be associated with their respective IPs in the same NDS event, if other users trust the user who made the registration they can configure their device to search from it, other users can copy the domain registration data and republish on their own.

Most Internet users do not have a fixed public IP, so the list referring to a website or relay domain may need to be updated from time to time, for this NDS events must be replaceable according to (NIP-16 Replaceable Events)

If the client finds NDS events from different users with the same domain name but for different IP addresses, the client will ask its respective user which one it trusts, then the client will start following the option the user chooses, then the person who found the different IPs can ask the user who posted that NDS event to fix it.

The owner of a site or relay himself can post an NDS event with a domain and the related IP and if people trust that owner they can accept this NDS event posted by him and so the client and/or browser will look for that address automatically without the need for a third party to assign names to an IP.

## Example:

```json
{
"id": <id>,
"pubkey": <pubkey>,
"created_at": <created_at>,
"kind": 10000,
"tags": [],
"content": "{\"Domain.Example1\":{\"6\":[\"[xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx]:port\"],\"4\":[\"xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port\",\"xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port\"],\"onion\":[\"xxxxxx.onion\"]},{\"Domain.Example2\":{\"6\":[\"[xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx]:port\"],\"onion\":[\"xxxxxx.onion\"]}",
"sig": <sig>
}
```
