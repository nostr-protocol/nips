Relay File Storage
------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines a way to store binary data on relays. It supports parallel uploads and resumable downloads.

## Upload

To upload a file, first client must convert its bytes to base64. It may do it in chunks which sizes are multiples of 3 bytes
(250000 bytes per chunk, for example) or in one go.
The base64 data will be used on the `.content` field of one or more `kind:1195` events to be uploaded to a relay.

The chunk events may be sent on separate websockets connections for parallel uploads.

## Event

An event of `kind:1195` represents a file chunk. A client may choose to split a file
into multiple chunks or use a single event.

The event `.pubkey` is NOT the uploader's one but a randomly generated pubkey. All chunks
use the same pubkey. The pubkey MUST NOT be reused on events other than the
`kind:1195` event set of a single file.
**The pubkey is what is used to uniquely identify the set of chunk events that make up the file**

The event `.content` is the base64-encoded file data.

It has a `c` tag. Its first falue is the chunk number while the second one is the total number of chunks.
The client can use the `c` tag to ask for missing chunks when resuming a download.

Example:

```js
{
  "id": "<id>",
  "pubkey": "<same-random-pubkey-for-all-event-chunks>"
  "kind": 1195,
  "tags": [
    ["c", "5", "20"] // required; this is the 5th chunk of a total of 20
  ],
  "content": "<base64-chunk>",
  "created_at": <timestamp>,
  "sig": "<signature>"
}
```

## Metadata

Metadata should be added using [NIP-94](94.md) or other metadata-related NIP.
If using NIP-94, instead of `kind:1063`, use `kind:1094` with the exact same format.
See [download section](#download) that adds two tags to be used in place of the `url` tag
on `kind:1094` events.

## File Relay

Client should upload to user's "file relays", which use the [NIP-65](65.md) `f` flag.
When downloading a file uploaded with this NIP, it should search on the uploader's "file relays".

**Relays must NOT honor `kind:5` deletion events referencing file chunk events.** Deletion
is expected to be automatic when no uploader is registered (see [Pre-Upload](#pre-upload) section
to learn how to register an uploader). If an user wants to make sure a file won't be deleted, it
should become an uploader of that file.

## Pre-Upload

Before uploading `kind:1195` events of a specifc file,
user MUST publish a single `kind:1095` "Uploader" event,
which is an event authored by the **user's main pubkey**,
with empty `.content` and an `f` tag referencing the `kind:1195`
event set (the `kind:1195` event(s) `.pubkey`). It also
has a `x` tag with the full file's hex-encoded sha256 hash that the
file relay may later validate.

Its purpose is to register the user as an uploader of the file on a specific relay and to request permission
for uploading the file chunks.

Example:

```js
{
  "id": "<id>",
  "pubkey": "<user's-main-pubkey>"
  "kind": 1095,
  "tags": [
    ["f", "<same-random-pubkey-for-all-event-chunks>"],
    ["x", "<Hash SHA-256>"]
  ],
  "content": "",
  "created_at": <timestamp>,
  "sig": "<signature>"
}
```

When receiving the `kind:1095` event, relay may answer with one of the following messages and prefixes:

- `["OK", "<kind:1095-event-id>", false, "auth-required: ..."]`: Authentication is required to register an uploader;
- `["OK", "<kind:1095-event-id>", true, "uploaded: ..."]`: The corresponding `kind:1195` file chunks are already uploaded, trying to re-upload them will fail;
- `["OK", "<kind:1095-event-id>", true, "upload: Missing chunks 1, 2, 7, 10"]`: File isn't uploaded yet or incomplete, user is allowed to upload it on this ws connection;

Trying to send a `kind:1195` event before a `kind:1095` one should fail.
Sending `kind:1095` events with an identifier (pubkey) different from the previously sent `kind:1195`'s `f` tag should fail.

A `kind:5` deletion event referencing a `kind:1095` event is used to unregister the user as an uploader.

Relay may split the burden of a single file by the multiple registered uploaders. For example, when there are 2 uploaders,
a file relay may charge each of them half of the costs to host the file.

Relay should delete the `kind:1095` event if no corresponding `kind:1195` event is uploaded within a reasonable period.

Clients may download `kind:1095` events from user's file relays to list all user files.

## nfile Entity

A [NIP-19](19.md) `nfile` bech32-encoded entity may be embedded directly on notes using a [NIP-21](21.md) URL.
It translates to two values:

1) The `kind:1195` set's pubkey, that is the address of the file chunks;
2) The uploader's pubkey, to be able to find the right "file relays" to download the file from.

## Download

This NIP introduces an `f` tag filled with the `kind:1195` pubkey, uniquely identifying the file chunk set,
and a `nip95u` tag set to the pubkey of the user who uploaded the file. Both are to
be present if using the NIP-94-like `kind:1094` event (instead of the `url` tag).

These two tag values can instead be encoded on an `nfile`.

Upon seeing such tags, in order to download the file, client should search for `kind:1195` events
by author (`f` tag value) on the `nip95u` uploader's "file relays".

Filter example:

`{ authors: ["<same-random-pubkey-for-all-event-chunks>"], kinds: [1195] }`

It must join the `.content` values from all the `kind:1195` events then convert it to bytes to recreate the file.
