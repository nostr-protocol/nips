NIP-97
=======

Attachments
-----------

`draft` `optional` `author:ondra-novak`

This NIP solves the problem of sharing and distributing binary content over NOSTR networks such as media - images, short videos music, or in general any files up to a certain size

Key Takeaways
-------------

* Defines how binary content (images, media, files) is managed by NOSTR network
* Allows sending private binary content in direct messages (encrypted)
* Defines new commands at the protocol level ("ATTACH","FETCH")
* Defines a new tag "attachment"
* Uses the binary messages in the websocket connection


New tag "attachment"
-------------
The proposal introduces a new tag  "attachment" with the following format

```
["attachment","hash_hex","size_in_bytes","mime_type","features1", "feature2", ....]
```

* **hash_hex** - hexadecimal representation of SHA256 hash of the attached binary file. This string also serves as **attachment-id**
* **size_in_bytes** - size of the attachment in bytes
* **mime_type** - mime type of the attachment 
* **features...** - optional fields with various features in format `<field>=<value>`
    * **blurhash=** - contains NIP-94 blurhash
    * **purpose=** - purpose of the attachment in context of current note. This can help client
to select optimal rendering. Suggested purposes
        * **thumbnail** - thubnail image of a following video
        * **story** - all attachments marked by this purpose are played as a story
        * **inline** - attachment is rendered in text, referenced by `#[<index>]`. This purpose hides this attachment from the list of attachments in note's detail.

```
["attachment","12887...","64000","image/jpeg","blurhash=qwdjq3...", "purpose=thumbnail"]
["attachment","874788...","2258147","video/mpeg4", "purpose=story"]
["attachment","ae3c758...","2158799","video/mpeg4", "purpose=story"]
["attachment","788eq78...","254123","image/jpeg", "purpose=story"]
```
        

* One event can have more than one of these tags, then it carries more attachments.
* Each relay defines the maximum attachment size and also the maximum number of attachments within an event
* Attachment can be attached to any "kind". Attachments for `kind:4` are always encrypted

The presence of the `attachment` attribute only informs the client that the relay should also have its own attachment content available in binary form. The client must download the attachments from the same relay to display them. See below


Upload
------
Single event must be published simultaneously with attachments. It is necessary to prevent the client from publishing the event but not uploading the relevant attachments. Similarly, it should not be possible to upload attachments first and then publish the event that references them. The operation must be atomic

For this reason, a new command is introduced: "ATTACH"

**Protocol flow**

```
client: ["ATTACH", <event>]
relay:  ["OK","<event-id">,true,"continue"]
client: <binary message for first attachment>
relay:  ["ATTACH",<attachment-id>, true, "continue"]
client: <binary message for second attachment>
relay:  ["ATTACH",<attachment-id>, true, "continue"]
...
...
client: <binary message for last attachment>
relay:  ["ATTACH",<attachment-id>, true, "complete"]
     //event is published
```

The protocol flow is designed in such a way that it is possible to post other commands between individual phases. Possible implementation on a relay:

```
- on ATTACH command
   - validate the event
   - store the event in a temporary storage associated with current connection

- on binary message
   - calculate SHA256 hash of the binary message
   - find matching attachment in list of attachment of events stored in the temporary storage
   - store the binary message as new attachment in the temporary storage
   - check if all attachments have been uploaded
        - is so, publish the stored event and attachments and delete them from temporary storage

 - on connection closed before completion
   - destroy temporary storage (no publish)
   
```


**NOTE** If the relay does not support this NIP, it will not be able to respond to the new command, or it will respond with "NOTICE". If the relay does not respond to the command within a certain time (e.g. 10 seconds), then the client should verify that the relay responds to other commands (for example "REQ") and evaluate the situation as if the relay does not support the functionality. If the relay responds to the command with a "NOTICE" response, the client must assume that the relay does not support the function and try another method

Response - ATTACH
--------------------------------------

Response for ATTACH is similar as response to EVENT. It uses "OK" response.

```
relay:  ["OK","<event-id">,true,"continue"]
```

The fourth argument may contain more detailed information about the operation. 
* `"continue"` - accepted, continue sending attachments
* `"duplicate"` - event is duplicate, you can still send attachments.

Errors - ATTACH
-----------------------------
When an error occurs after an ATTACH command, the client must not send any binary messages in this case.

Error description is specified as fouth argument

```
relay:  ["OK","<event-id">,false,"error"]
```

* `"max_attachment_size: <number>"` - one of the attachments exceeded the maximum size allowed, the relay sends this limit as a number in the error description section
* `"max_attachment_count: <number>"` - the number of attachments has exceeded the allowed limit. Again, the relay sends this limit as a number in the error description section
* `"<event-id">,false,"invalid: <description>"` - event is malformed, missing mandatory fields, or event doesn't have attachments


Response - binary messages
--------------------------------------

Relay must respond to each binary message with a ["ATTACH"] response. The response has the same format as "OK"

The fourth argument may contain more detailed information about the operation. 

```
relay:  ["ATTACH","<attachment-id">,true,"description"]
```

* `"continue"` - accepted, continue sending attachments
* `"complete"` - event has been posted
* `"duplicate"` - event has been posted, but was duplicated (so it was discarded)


Errors - binary messages
--------------------------------------
```
relay:  ["ATTACH","<attachment-id">,false,"description"]
```

Error description is specified as fouth argument

* `"invalid: mismatch"` - Binary message doesn't match any expected attachment. For example, the hash or size doesn't match.



Encryption - kind:4
-------------------

Attachments are sent encrypted for "kind:4". The same encryption is used as in the encryption of the message itself. An initialization vector (16 bytes) is stored at the beginning of the binary message and then the binary content itself.

```
[IV 16 bytes][ encrypted content ]
```

Download 
--------

The "FETCH" command is used to download the attachment from the relay

**Protocol flow**

```
client: ["FETCH","<attachment-id>"]
relay:  ["FETCH","<attachment-id>", true, "mime/type"]
relay:  <binary message>
```

If the attachment does not exist, the response looks like this


```
client: ["FETCH","<attachment-id>"]
relay:  ["FETCH","<attachment-id>", false, "missing: not found"]
```
In this case, the relay must not generate a binary message

Encrypted attachments must be decrypted at client side.


Reuse existing attachment
-------------------------

To avoid reupload of the same file, you can use special form of FETCH command to 
attach existing attachment to a new event. This can be useful for long articles in case that user just posts an update of the article.

```
client: ["FETCH","<attachment-id>","ATTACH"]
relay: ["ATTACH","<attachment-id>",true,"continue/complete/duplicate"]
```

in case that attachment doesn't exists

```
client: ["FETCH","<attachment-id>","ATTACH"]
relay: ["ATTACH","<attachment-id>",false,"missing: not found"]
```

in case that attachment doesn't match to any expected attachment

```
client: ["FETCH","<attachment-id>","ATTACH"]
relay: ["ATTACH","<attachment-id>",false,"invalid: mismatch"]
```

This command also "locks" the attachment in order to prevent to be scarped by a garbage collector (see below)


Changes in relay information document (NIP-11)
-----------------------------------------------

New items are added in the "limitation" section

```
 "limitation": {
    "max_attachment_count": 4,
    "max_attachment_size": 262144,
  }
```

* **max_attachment_count** - maximum count of attachments per event
* **max_attachment_size** -- maximum size of single attachment in bytes


Garbage collecting
------------------

Relay should perform garbage collecting of attachments without any reference on events. 

Command summary
-----------------

Client to Relay

* **ATTACH** - initiate publication of the event with attachments.
* **FETCH** - request to download an attachment

Relay to Client
* **OK** - accept or reject ATTACH command
* **ATTACT** - accept or reject binary message
* **FETCH** - accept or reject FETCH request
