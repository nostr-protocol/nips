Read Status
-----------

`draft` `optional`

Clients may wish to track whether certain events have been seen by a user, including mentions, replies, likes, messages, community posts, and more.

A kind `15` event may be used to mark one or more `e` tags as read.

```json
{
  "kind": "15",
  "tags": [
    ["expiration", "<one year in the future>"],
    ["e", "<event1_id>"],
    ["e", "<event1_id>"]
  ]
}
```

Events MAY be wrapped as described in [NIP 59](./59.md) in order to create private read status events. These can be useful for preserving user privacy, or to selectively reveal read status to other users, for example in a group chat or message thread.

Read status events SHOULD expire after a sufficient amount of time to save storage space, since very old events can be assumed to have been seen. Wrapped events SHOULD put the `expiration` tag on the wrapper event. See [NIP 40](./40.md) for more information expiration.
