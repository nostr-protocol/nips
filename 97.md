Ring Signatures
---------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP describes a protocol to associate any standard nostr event with a ring signature of is content field, as introduced by Rivest, Shamir, and Tauman in their 2001 paper "How to Leak a Secret" [1].

## Background and Motivation

In the original paper, Rivest, Shamir, and Tauman use the example of "a high-ranking White House official" who wishes to leak a secret without revealing which official signed the message.

Suppose that a set of entities each have public/private key pairs, (pk1, sk1), (p21, s21), ..., (pkn, skn). Party _i_ can compute a ring signature σ on a message `m`, on input (`m`, `ski`, `pk1`, ..., `pkn`). Anyone can check the validity of a ring signature given `σ`, `m`, and the public keys involved, `pk1`, ..., `pkn`.

## Requirements

A ring signature event must meet three requirements:
- a content field which contains the message `m`, the message to be signed by the ring signature
- a `ring-signature` tag that identifies the event as a Ring Signature event and that contains the ring signature `σ`
- One `ring-members` tag which contains an array of all public keys (`pki`) in the ring.

### Event kinds

Any event kind that utilizes the content field (e.g. kind 1, 30023 (long form), 30818 (wiki), etc.) can make use of this NIP. However, this NIP also introduces a new event kind, kind 2001, which may optionally be used to link a pseudonym to a list of signatories, as described below.

## Usage

Suppose nostr user Alice with `pk_Alice` wants to leak a secret `m` without revealing her pubkey, other than that `pk_Alice` is an element of some set `S` of (presumably well-known and highly regarded) pubkeys [`pk1`, `pk2`, ..., `pkn`]. She will use `pk_Alice` to generate the ring signature `σ` but will create a throwaway ring signature pubkey `pk_ring-signature` to wrap the secret in a nostr event as in the examples below.

## Examples

Generic example:
```json
{
  "content": "secret message",
  "kind": 1, // or 30023 (long form), 30818 (wiki), etc
  "tags": [
    ["ring-signature", σ],
    ["ring-members", [<pk1>,<pk2>, ..., <pkn>]],
  ],
  "pubkey": "<pk_ring-signature>"
}
```

In this example, Alice holds the private keys to `pk_Alice` and to `pk_ring-signature`. `pk_Alice` is one of the `pkn`. The public will know (can verify cryptographically) that `σ` was generated by one of the `pkn` but will not know know which one.

**One-time use:**

In the base case, `pk_ring-signature` is used for this one event without the intent of reuse:

```json
{
  "content": "I'm a cabinet member of Trusted But Corrupt Organization. In this note, I will spill the beans and tell the whole store from start to finish ...",
  "kind": 1, // or 30023 (long form), 30818 (wiki), etc
  "tags": [
    ["ring-signature", σ],
    ["ring-members", [<pk_cabinet-member_1>,<pk_cabinet-member_2>, ..., <pk_cabinet-member_n>]],
  ],
  "pubkey": "<pk_ring-signature>"
}
```

**Repeated use:**

If Alice decides to create a Ring-Signature-linked pseudonym for repeated use, she uses kind 2001 to "announce" her pseudonym, as in this example:

```json
{
  "content": "I'm a cabinet member ... This is the first in a series of notes, all of which will be signed by this pubkey (pk_ring-signature), in which I spill the beans on ...",
  "kind": 2001,
  "tags": [
    ["ring-signature", σ],
    ["ring-members", [<pk_cabinet-member_1>,<pk_cabinet-member_2>, ..., <pk_cabinet-member_n>]],
  ],
  "pubkey": "<pk_ring-signature>"
}
```

In this case, `pk_ring-signature` evolves from a simple throwaway to become a bona fide pseudonym. Note that `pk_ring-signature` is referenced in the content field and is therefore included within the ring signature message `m`.

## Nostr Relays and Clients

A strength of this implementation is that relays and clients that do not support RS will nevertheless store, transmit and process them in the usual fashion, including display of content.

Relays and clients that do support this NIP will do so in the following ways:

### cryptographic validation of the ring signature (REQUIRED)

### Web-of-trust score for the Ring Signature Pubkey (OPTIONAL)

Given an appropriately selected web of trust (WoT) scoring method, calculate a trust score for the `pubkey_ring-signature`, a "ring signature WoT score" RS_WoT, which is the _minimum / lowest / worst / most untrustworthy WoT score for all pki in the set S_. RS_WoT is effectively the "weakest link" of all the pubkeys in S. Users may wish to filter and discard as probable spam any RS event based on RS_WoT. But if RS_WoT is high-trust, and if Alice wishes to maintain `pk_ring-signature` as a pseudonym for repeated use, then RS_WoT can be used as a floor upon which to build a reputation. Note: in this scenario, it is also essential for `pk_ring-signature` to be included within the signed message `m` to prevent any rando from attempting to appropriate the reputation of RS_WoT by republishing the RS. (See the Repeated Use example above, where `pk_ring-signature` is included in the signed message `m`.)

### Non-WoT methods for spam prevention (OPTIONAL)

PoW ([NIP-13](./13.md)) for spam prevention, since in standard used cases `pk_ring-signature` will be unknown and unvetted by WoT, thus making spam prevention by other means difficult.
