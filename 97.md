Private Events
--------------

`draft` `optional`


An event containing an `"!"` tag means a private event. Relays supporting private events MUST serve private notes only to [NIP-98](98.md) AUTHed pubkeys presented in users' kind `10103` [NIP-51](51.md) list.

Example of private event:

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [
    ["!"],
    ["relays", "wss://private-notes.example.com", "wss://secret-notes.example.com", /*...*/],
  ],
  "content": "You can't see it before i grant you this permission!",
  // other fields...
}
```

Clients SHOULD publish private events with a protected tag (`"-"`) to relays who implement and respect this spec.

### Private Follow Request

A user can request to be added to a pubkey kind `10103` list using a kind `5030` event containing the target pubkey in a `"p"` tag:

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 5030,
  "tags": [
    ["relays", "wss://private-notes.example.com", "wss://secret-notes.example.com", /*...*/],
    ["p", "abc...def"]
  ],
  "content": "Please let me in.",
  // other fields...
}
```

Clients MAY show `.content` to user as a request message.
Its RECOMMENDED for clients to add a `"expiration"` tag to kind `5030` since they won't be useful after being accepted or rejected.
Its RECOMMENDED for relays to cleanup kind `5030` after a reasonable amount of time since they won't be useful after being accepted or rejected.

### Clients

Clients SHOULD keep sending reactions, comments and replies to this events to same relays with protected and private tags, keeping the rest of information private.

#### Warning

The events could be downloaded by private followers and saved locally.
