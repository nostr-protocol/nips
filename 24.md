Private Direct Messages and Small Group Chats
---------------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:vitorpamplona` `author:kieran` `author:paulmillr` `author:staab`

This NIP establishes an encrypted direct messaging scheme with the following privacy guarantees: 

1. **Superior Encryption**: Messages are encrypted with XChaCha ([NIP-44](44.md)) to each participant's public key individually.
2. **No Metadata Leak**: Participant identities, each message's real date and time, event kinds, and other tags are all hidden from the public
3. **Onion Layers**: Senders and receivers cannot be linked with public information alone ([NIP-59](59.md)).
4. **Trust-minimized**: DM/Group members cannot expose verifiable details of your message, including the metadata, without leaking their main private key completely
5. **No Identifiers**: There is no central queue, channel or otherwise converging event id to link or count all messages in the same group. 
6. **No Moderation**: There is no group admins, no invitations or bans.
7. **No Shared Secrets**: There is no chatroom secret key that can leak or be mistakently shared
8. **Fully Recoverable**: Messages can be fully recoverable in any client with the receiver or the sender's private key
9. **Optional Forward Secrecy**: Users and clients can opt-in for "disappearing messages" that are not recoverable with their private key
10. **Uses Public Relays**: The protocol's messages can flow through public relays without loss of privacy. Private relays can increase privacy further, but they are not needed.
11. **Cold Storage**: Users will be able to also opt-in to sharing messages with a new key exclusive for DM backup and recovery.
11. **Composible**: The protocol is extensible to make any other event kind fully private (private likes, private reports, private long-form content, etc)

## 1. The Unsigned Direct Message

A new `kind:14` defines a Chat Message between a group of users (i.e. pubkey + p-tags). 

It is designed to be a Rumor in [NIP-59](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/716/files) and thus MUST never be signed. If it is signed, the information in it is **fully public**. This event kind requires the rest of the protocol to make it private. 

```js
{
  "id": "<The usual hash>",
  "pubkey": "<author key in hex>",
  "content": "This is a DM",
  "kind": 14,
  "created_at": 1686840217,
  "tags": [ <one or more receivers, mentions, citations, additional fields like content-sensitivity, etc> ],
}
```

The `.content` contains the message. 

The set of `pubkey` + `p` tags define a Group. Clients SHOULD render messages with the same group in a continuous thread. If a new `p` tag is added, a new group is created. 

An optional `subject` tag defines the current name/topic of the conversation. Any member can change the topic by simply submitting a new `subject` to an existng `pubkey` + `p`-tags group. 

The use of other tags is highly encouraged (e.g. such as `content-warning` ([NIP-36](36.md)) if the content is NSFW). 

## 2. The Seal

A Seal is a `kind:13` event that authenticates the author of the encrypted message. It wraps the **unsigned** `kind:14` event (the Rumor) and is signed with the sender's regular key. 

```js
{
  "id": "<The usual hash>",
  "pubkey": "<Author's Main PubKey>",
  "content": "<XCHACHA-Encrypted Base64 of the Kind 14>",
  "kind": 13,
  "created_at": 1686840217,			// No need to match the current time
  "tags": [],   					// Always empty
  "sig": "<Author's Main PubKey Signature>"
}
```

The Sealed Rumor is **always** encrypted to a receiver's pubkey but **no** `p` tag pointing to the receiver is used. The receiver's information is not public. The only public information in this event is who is signing it. 

Clients MUST verify if pubkey of the `kind:13` is the pubkey on the `kind:14`, otherwise any author can impersonate others by simply changing the pubkey on `kind:14`.

Clients SHOULD randomize `created_at` to reduce time-collisions.

Tags MUST must always be empty. The inner event MUST always be unsigned. The encryption algorithm MUST use [NIP-44](44.md). 

## 3. The Gift Wrap

A GiftWrap event (`kind:1059`) wraps `kind:13` events. 

It is signed by a single-use (i.e. random) key and it is `p`-addressed to the receiver. 

The only public information is the receiver's public key. 

```js
{
  "id": "<The usual hash>",
  "pubkey": "<Random, one-time-use PubKey>",
  "content": "<XCHACHA-Encrypted Base64 of the Kind 13>",
  "kind": 1059,
  "created_at": 1686840217,
  "tags": [
    [ "p", "<Receiver>" ] // the only tag allowed
  ],
  "sig": "<Random, one-time-use PubKey Signature>"
}
```

A `p` tag for the recipient MUST be added to the `tags` field of a GiftWrap. 

Clients SHOULD randomize `created_at` towards the past (some relays don't receive future events) to reduce time-collisions.

Clients pull all GiftWraps citing their user and decrypt the gift-wrapped event with the user's private key to get the Seal and to know where this Gift is coming from. After breaking the seal, the Client can see the message, date/time as we as any pertinent tags. 

Note: Gift wraps alone are an effective tool to hide information from the public. However, the inner event can be easily re-broadcasted, breaking the privacy of the sender and leaking its metadata (e.g. author, event kind, dates, tags, etc). Thus in this NIP, the GiftWrap MUST wrap a Sealed Rumor Event to make sure the receiver cannot break the privacy guarantees when re-broadcasting it. 
 
## 4. Complete Algorithm

To send a private message:

1. create a kind `Kind:14` event with the message in its `.content` and a p-Tag to one or more receivers. 
2. Remove the signature and serialize as JSON. 
3. Encrypt the serialized `Kind:14` to the receiver's public key. 
4. Seal it with a `kind:13` event, signed by the sender's main key. 

Then for each receiver + sender: 

1. Create a new key
2. Serialize the seal as JSON
3. Encrypt it into a `kind:1059` GiftWrap with a tag to the receiver
4. Sign the event with the new random key
5. Broadcast the `kind:1059` event to the relays of the receiver

## 5. Final Considerations

This proposal makes heavy use of one-time keys to elevate the privacy of Nostr messages. It can be applied to any Nostr event kind (e.g. private reactions), but the focus here is on private messages.

It's worth noting that the only `created_at` time that matters is with the `kind:14` event. All the other time-attributes SHOULD be tweaked to reduce the time-collision.

Relays may choose not to store Gift Wraps due to the risks associated with unkown encrypted information. Users MAY choose to attach a certain amount of proof-of-work to the wrapper event in a bid to demonstrate it is not spam or a denial-of-service attack.

To protect recipient metadata, relays SHOULD only serve kind 1059 events to the requesting user. If a relay implements some form of authentication it can refuses to serve wrapped events to non-recipients. 

When possible, Clients SHOULD only send wrapped events to `read` relays of each recipient.

## 8. Private Group Chat, Step by Step

Let's send a message from `5b107933d9520411dbc6ed9ece42bbec8b930978671a6e9782528a74d70eb5e6` to `2f27f7d08bd618c4c9a050d923ed915a693ecb3e5d399b26ef0829f29a51035f` and `2f3b57b49531b5fc714307f53eda525eacf1733f5dc30e9c2ac57b60045c3e28`, asking "Who is going to the party tonight?"

### 8.1. Create a ChatMessage event

Create a `kind:14` with the message, the receivers, and any other tags you want, signed by the author. 

```json
{
  "id":"8db65e089967d0be99f367f5f242678ba91bd20bd5e1a0a3b90bb2ebfd15e51d",
  "pubkey":"4e47afb3ce48dcc51f6b270342e64586906c01dcb13750a769379a3d201da426",
  "created_at":1692241796,
  "kind":14,
  "tags":[
    [ "p", "c8e87f7a1fa75d203563932f843f06c88d02d242744304804a63356cccf77768" ]
  ],
  "content":"Who is going to the party tonight?",
  "sig":"92512091dc1b1ae040a1cbd79d947f0669cba3f7664fd49f6b83d673880c474adc3927c56a89db6263f05f22123dc1ed1b557d7a1ee2df428dccac63d5ab140e"
}
```

### 8.2. Make it a Rumor

Remove the signature to make it unverifiable if leaked.

```json
{
  "id":"8db65e089967d0be99f367f5f242678ba91bd20bd5e1a0a3b90bb2ebfd15e51d",
  "pubkey":"4e47afb3ce48dcc51f6b270342e64586906c01dcb13750a769379a3d201da426",
  "created_at":1692241796,
  "kind":14,
  "tags":[
    [ "p", "c8e87f7a1fa75d203563932f843f06c88d02d242744304804a63356cccf77768" ]
  ],
  "content":"Who is going to the party tonight?",
}
```

### 8.3. For each of the 3 participants

#### 8.3.1. Seal the Rumor
   
Encrypt the JSON-Stringified Rumor with the **Sender**'s key to the participant, create a `kind:13` event and sign it with the **Sender**'s key

```json
{
  "id":"fc31b72ac267e83e62bee591d2710cfa3499f662dbc5d1976c00d87baf455680",

}
```
	
Notice how there are no tags declared in this event. 

#### 8.3.2. Get a Random Key 

We are using private key `3436da6d596c361dead74a207ceabb6c882f65ebc901a15b5be6a374fa91355f` in this example

#### 8.3.3. Create the Gift Wrap
   
Encrypt the JSON-Stringified `kind:13` with the Random key and create a Gift Wrap event for the participant

Notice that the signer is a random key.

#### 8.3.4. Broadcast Selectively
   
Broadcast the `kind:1059` event to the participant's relays only. Delete all the other events.
