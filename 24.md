Extra metadata fields and tags
------------------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP keeps track of extra optional fields that can added to events which are not defined anywhere else but have become _de facto_ standards and other minor implementation possibilities that do not deserve their own NIP and do not have a place in other NIPs.

kind 0
======

These are extra fields not specified in NIP-01 that may be present in the stringified JSON of metadata events:

  - `display_name`: an alternative, bigger name with richer characters than `name`. `name` should always be set regardless of the presence of `display_name` in the metadata.
  - `website`: a web URL related in any way to the event author.
  - `banner`: an URL to a wide (~1024x768) picture to be optionally displayed in the background of a profile screen.
  - `bot`: a boolean to clarify that the content is entirely or partially the result of automation, such as with chatbots or newsfeeds.
  - `birthday`: an object representing the author's birth date. The format is { "year": number, "month": number, "day": number }. Each field MAY be omitted.
  - `organization`: a boolean to clarify that the author is an organization such as a business, non-profit, social club, government entity etc.
  - `org_info`: an object representing details about the organization represented by the author. The format is { "streetAddress": string, "streetAddress2": string, "municipality": string, "metro": string, "province": string, "postcode": string, "country": string, "scope": string, "geohash": string, "orgType": string, "sector": string, "categories": string[] }. No field is required. 
    - `streetAddress`: a string including the address number and street name (eg. "123 Sesame St").
    - `streetAddress2`: a string including the rest of the address when more specific addressing is required. May be used for more specific qualifiers (eg. "Ste 12" or "Building C, Floor 3, Unit 32") or for broader qualifiers if the local addressing system requires it such as neighborhood. 
    - `municipality`: a string of the municipality the organization is located in (eg. "Omaha" or "Brooklyn").
    - `metro`: a string of the city, whose metro area the organization serves, even if it is located in a nearby municipality (eg. "Atlanta" if the author is a store located in Marietta, GA).
    - `province`: a string of the province or state name, written out (eg. "New York", "Ontario", "New South Wales").
    - `postcode`: a string of the postal code (eg. "11218" or "M5S 2C6").
    - `country`: a string of the ISO 3166-2 code (2 character abbreviation) of the country (eg. "US" or "UK").
    - `scope`: a string specifying the scope of the organization's operations. MUST be one of the following strings: "municipality", "metro", "province", "country", "international".
    - `geohash`: a string of the [geohash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash) of the organization.
    - `orgType`: a string specifying the type of organization. MUST be one of the following strings: "commercial", "non-profit", "government-body", "social-club".
    - `categories`: an array of strings describing the specific categories the organization identifies with (eg. "Restaurant", "Auto Parts Store", "Open Source Project", "Foundation", "Food Bank" etc). The first element SHOULD be the most relevant description that should show up when viewing the author's profile. 
    - Notes: 
     - `streetAddress`, `streetAddress2`, `municipality`, `province`, `country`, `postcode` SHOULD be plaintext strings formatted such that they are both readable when rendered directly but also a valid unambigious mailing address that can be scraped and mailed or navigated to by concatenating in that order.
     - `metro` SHOULD only be provided when relevant. eg. any organization that is not completely confined to a single municipality but are limited to a single metro area due to physical accessibility. Orgs that SHOULD include `metro`: small businesses, social clubs, local non-profits, religious congregations etc.
     - `scope` should be thought of in terms of the audience you want to reach. If `scope` is "metro", this is a signal to clients that this organization is relevant to users in or near the author's metro area but is not concerned specifically with reaching users in the next city over. This isn't exactly a solid distinction as a small business in a smaller metro area will want to reach the whole area while the same business in somewhere like Brooklyn may not care at all about reaching anyone outside Brooklyn.
     - if `municipality` is provided, `province` MUST be provided as well.
     - if `province` is provided, `country` MUST be provided as well. 
     - `categories` SHOULD include all categorizations that accurately describe the business. The first element should be the most relevant one. eg. a Subway franchise would have "Sub Shop" as it's first category even if they also want to be discoverable under "Restaurant", "Fast Food" and "Take-out Restaurant".


### Deprecated fields

These are fields that should be ignored or removed when found in the wild:

  - `displayName`: use `display_name` instead.
  - `username`: use `name` instead.

kind 3
======

These are extra fields not specified in NIP-02 that may be present in the stringified JSON of follow events:

### Deprecated fields

  - `{<relay-url>: {"read": <true|false>, "write": <true|false>}, ...}`: an object of relays used by a user to read/write. [NIP-65](65.md) should be used instead.

tags
====

These tags may be present in multiple event kinds. Whenever a different meaning is not specified by some more specific NIP, they have the following meanings:

  - `r`: a web URL the event is referring to in some way.
  - `i`: an external id the event is referring to in some way - see [NIP-73](73.md).
  - `title`: name of [NIP-51](51.md) sets, [NIP-52](52.md) calendar event, [NIP-53](53.md) live event or [NIP-99](99.md) listing.
  - `t`: a hashtag. The value MUST be a lowercase string.
