Rich Text Note
--------------

`draft` `optional` `author:AsaiToshiya`

This NIP defines kinds for a "rich text note" such as HTML and Markdown that are primarily displayed in "social" clients.

Events with these kinds are basically the same as kind `1` but with different the `content`.

## Event Kinds

| kind   | type     |
| ------ | -------- |
| `1011` | HTML     |
| `1012` | Markdown |

### HTML

This type of event uses kind `1011`.

The `content` should be written in HTML. And it can include references to other events using [NIP-21](21.md).

Example event:

```json
{
  "kind": 1011,
  "content": "Lorem <b>ipsum</b> nostr:note1fntxtkcy9pjwucqwa9mddn7v03wwwsu9j330jj350nvhpky2tuaspk6nqc",
  ...other fields the same as kind 1
}
```

### Markdown

This type of event uses kind `1012`.

The `content` should be written in Markdown. And it can include references to other events using [NIP-21](21.md).

As mentioned in the introduction, this differs from [NIP-23](23.md) in that it expects to be displayed in "social" clients.

Example event:

```json
{
  "kind": 1012,
  "content": "Lorem **ipsum** nostr:note1fntxtkcy9pjwucqwa9mddn7v03wwwsu9j330jj350nvhpky2tuaspk6nqc",
  ...other fields the same as kind 1
}
```
