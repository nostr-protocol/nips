HTTP File Storage Integration
-----------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:arthurfranca` `author:Semisol` `author:staab`

## Introduction

This NIP defines a REST API for HTTP file storage servers intended to be used in conjunction with the nostr network.
The API will enable nostr users to upload files and later reference them by url on nostr notes.

The spec DOES NOT use regular nostr events through websockets for
storing, requesting nor retrieving data because, for simplicity, the server
will not have to learn anything about nostr relays.

## Server Adaptation

File storage servers wishing to be accessible by nostr users should opt-in by making available an https route at `/.well-known/nostr/nip96.json` with `api_url`:

```js
{
  // Required
  // File upload and deletion are served from this url
  // Also downloads if "download_url" field is absent or empty string
  "api_url": "https://your-file-server.example/custom-api-path",
  // Optional
  // If absent, downloads are served from the api_url
  "download_url": "https://a-cdn.example/a-path",
  // Optional
  // Use this if you are a nostr relay using your /.well-known/nostr/nip96.json
  // just to advertise someone else's http file storage server's /.well-known/nostr/nip96.json
  // In this case, "api_url" field must be an empty string
  "recommended_url": "https://your-file-server.example",
  // Optional
  "supported_nips": [],
  // Optional
  "tos_url": "https://your-file-server.example/terms-of-service",
  // Optional
  "plans": {
    // "free" is the only standardized plan key and
    // clients may use its presence to learn if server offers free storage
    "free": {
      "name": "Free Tier",
      "url": "https://...", // payment etc
      "max_byte_size": 10485760,
      // Range in days / 0 for no expiration
      // [7, 0] means it may vary from 7 days to unlimited persistence,
      // [0, 0] means it has no expiration
      // early expiration may be due to low traffic or any other factor
      "file_expiration": [14, 90],
      "image_transformations": ["resizing"]
    }
  }
}
```

Note that if using a CDN, the `server` MAY issue a 302 redirect from
GET requests to the `api_url` or `download_url` route to the CDN url instead
of assigning the CDN directly as the `download_url` route.
This is because some NIP-96 integrations
MAY require NIP-98 authentication for downloads,
which the CDN won't be able to support.

### Relay Hints

A nostr relay MAY advertise someone else's HTTP file storage server by
adding a `/.well-known/nostr/nip96.json` with "recommended_url" field
pointing to the url where the server hosts its own
`/.well-known/nostr/nip96.json`. In this case, the "api_url" must
be an empty string.

If the nostr relay is also an HTTP file storage server,
it must use the "api_url" field instead.

### List of Supporting File Storage Servers

| Name | Domain |
| ---- | ------ |
| -    | -      |

## Upload

A file can be uploaded one at a time to `https://your-file-server.example/custom-api-path` (route from `https://your-file-server.example/.well-known/nostr/nip96.json` "api_url" field) as `multipart/form-data` content type using `POST` method with the file object set to the `file` form data field.

`Clients` must add a [NIP-98](98.md) `Authorization` header with the encoded `payload` tag set to the base64-encoded 256-bit SHA-256 hash of the file (not the hash of the whole request body).
If using an html form, use an `Authorization` form data field instead.

These following **optional** form data fields MAY be used by `servers` and SHOULD be sent by `clients`:
- `expiration`: string of the UNIX timestamp in seconds. Empty string if file should be stored forever. The server isn't required to honor this;
- `size`: string of the file byte size. This is just a value the server can use to reject early if the file size exceeds the server limits;
- `alt`: strict description text for visibility-impaired users;
- `caption`: loose description;
- `content_type`: mime type such as "image/jpeg".

Others custom form data fields may be used depending on specific `server` support.
The `server` isn't required to store any metadata sent by `clients`.

Note for `clients`: if using an HTML form, it is important for the `file` form field to be the **last** one, or be re-ordered right before sending or be appended as the last field of XHR2's FormData object.

The `filename` embedded in the file may not be honored by the `server`, which could internally store just the SHA-256 hash value as the file name, ignoring extra metadata.
The hash is enough to uniquely identify a file, that's why it will be used on the "download" and "delete" routes.

The `server` MUST link the user's `pubkey` string (which is embedded in the decoded header value) as the owner of the file so to later allow him to delete the file.
Note that if a file with the same hash of a previously received file (so the same file) is uploaded by another user, the server doesn't need to store the new file.
It should just add the new user's `pubkey` to the list of the owners of the already stored file with said hash.

The `server` SHOULD also store the `Authorization` header/field value (decoded or not) for accountability purpose as this proves that the user with the unique pubkey did ask for the upload.

The `server` MUST reject with 413 Payload Too Large if file size exceeds limits.

The `server` MUST reject with 400 Bad Request status if some fields are invalid.

The `server` MUST reject the upload with 403 Forbidden status if the `payload` tag value contains an already used SHA-256 hash (if file is already owned by the same pubkey) or it isn't the same of the received file.

The `server` MAY reject the upload with 402 Payment Required status if the user has a pending payment (Payment flow is not strictly required. Server owners decide if the storage is free or not. Monetization schemes may be added later to correlated NIPs.).

The upload response is a json object as follows:

```js
{
  nip96: {
    // Same from /.well-known/nostr/nip96.json's "download_url" field
    // (or "api_url" field if "download_url" is absent or empty)
    download_url: "https://your-file-server.example/custom-api-path",
    // Server hostname where one can find the /.well-known/nostr/nip96.json config resource
    // It may be different from the "download_url" domain
    hint_url: "https://your-file-server.example",
    // SHA-256 hash. Empty string if unsuccessful
    x: "719171db19525d9d08dd69cb716a18158a249b7b3b3ec4bbdec5698dca104b7b",
  },
  errors: {
    // Empty array if successful
    nip96: ['error 1', 'error 2']
  }
}
```

`Clients` may upload the same file to one or many `servers`.
After successful upload, the `client` may optionally generate and send to any set of nostr `relays` a [NIP-94](94.md) event with at least these tags (please read the included comments):

```js
[
  // Note we appended .png from the original uploaded file extension to the received `x` value
  // (it is optional but extremely recommended to add the extension as it will help nostr clients with detecting the file type by using regular expression)
  ["url", "https://your-file-server.example/custom-api-path/719171db19525d9d08dd69cb716a18158a249b7b3b3ec4bbdec5698dca104b7b.png"],
  [
    "x",
    "719171db19525d9d08dd69cb716a18158a249b7b3b3ec4bbdec5698dca104b7b",
    // Server hostname (from nip96.hint_url response)
    // where one can find the /.well-known/nostr/nip96.json config resource.
    "https://your-file-server.example"
  ]
]
```

The `x` tag's third value is an important hint that clients can use to find new NIP-96 compatible file storage servers.

Alternatively, instead of using NIP-94, the `client` can share or embed on a nostr note just the above url with added "x" [NIP-54](54.md) inline metadata field values and optionally other fields such as "m" for mime type.

### File compression

File compression is optionally done at the `client`, **never on server**, before uploading.
This is done to assure the same file hash result, no matter to how many servers one may upload the same file.

## Download

`Servers` must make available the route `https://your-file-server.example/custom-api-path/<sha256-file-hash>(.ext)` (route from `https://your-file-server.example/.well-known/nostr/nip96.json` "api_url" or "download_url" field) with `GET` method for file download.

Supporting ".ext", meaning "file extension", is required for `servers`. It is optional, although recommended, for `clients` to append it to the path.
When present it may be used by `servers` to know which `Content-Type` header to send (e.g.: "Content-Type": "image/png" for ".png" extension).
The file extension may be absent because the hash is the only needed string to uniquely identify a file.

Example: `https://your-file-server.example/custom-api-path/719171db19525d9d08dd69cb716a18158a249b7b3b3ec4bbdec5698dca104b7b.png`

### Image Transformations

`Servers` may respond to some image transformation query parameters and ignore those they don't support by serving
the original image file without transformations.

#### Resizing

Upon upload, `servers` may create resized image variants, such as thumbnails, respecting the original aspect ratio.
`Clients` may use the `w` query parameter to request an image version with the desired pixel width.
`Servers` can then serve the variant with the closest width to the parameter value
or an image variant generated on the fly.

Example: `https://your-file-server.example/custom-api-path/<sha256-file-hash>.png?w=32`

## Deletion

`Servers` must make available the route `https://deletion.domain/deletion-path/<sha256-file-hash>(.ext)` (route from `https://your-file-server.example/.well-known/nostr/nip96.json` "api_url" field) with `DELETE` method for file deletion.
The extension is optional as the file hash is the only needed file identification.

`Clients` should send a `DELETE` request to the server deletion route in the above format. It must include a NIP-98 `Authorization` header.

The `server` should reject deletes from users other than the original uploader. The `pubkey` encoded on the header value identifies the user.

It should be noted that more than one user may have uploaded the same file (with the same hash). In this case, a delete must not really delete the file but just remove the user's `pubkey` from the file owners list.

The response is similar to the json sent on uploads, but without the `nip96.download_url` field.
