HTTP File Storage Integration
-----------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:arthurfranca` `author:Semisol` `author:staab`

## Motivation

This NIP defines a simple unified REST API for HTTP file storage servers so to integrate them to the nostr network.
The API will enable nostr users to upload files and later reference them by url on nostr notes.

The spec DOES NOT use regular nostr events through websockets for
storing, requesting nor retrieving data because, for simplicity, the server
will not have to learn anything about nostr relays.

## Server Adaptation

File storage servers wishing to be accessible by nostr users should opt-in by making available
an https route at `/nip96(/<sha256-file-hash>)` for handling files as described below.

## Upload

A file can be uploaded one at a time to `https://server.domain/nip96` as `multipart/form-data` content type using `POST` method with the file object set to the `file` form data field.

`Clients` must add a [NIP-98](98.md) `Authorization` header with the encoded `payload` tag set to the base64-encoded 256-bit SHA-256 hash of the file (not the hash of the whole request body).
If using an html form, use an `Authorization` form data field instead.

These following **optional** form data fields MAY be used by `servers` and SHOULD be sent by `clients`:
- `expiration`: string of the UNIX timestamp in seconds. Empty string if file should be stored forever. The server isn't required to honor this;
- `size`: string of the file byte size. This is just a value the server can use to reject early if the file size exceeds the server limits;
- `alt`: strict description text for visibility-impaired users;
- `caption`: loose description.

Others custom form data fields may be used depending on specific `server` support.
The `server` isn't required to store any metadata sent by `clients`.

Note for `clients`: if using an HTML form, it is important for the `file` form field to be the **last** one, or be re-ordered right before sending or be appended as the last field of XHR2's FormData object.

The `filename` embedded in the file may not be honored by the `server`, which could internally store just the SHA-256 hash value as the file name, ignoring extra metadata.
The hash is enough to uniquely identify a file, that's why it will be used on the "download" and "delete" routes.

The `server` MUST link the user's `pubkey` string (which is embedded in the decoded header value) as the owner of the file so to later allow him to delete the file.
Note that if a file with the same hash of a previously received file (so the same file) is uploaded by another user, the server doesn't need to store the new file.
It should just add the new user's `pubkey` to the list of the owners of the already stored file with said hash.

The `server` MUST reject the upload if the `payload` tag value contains an already used SHA-256 hash (if file is already owned by the same pubkey) or it isn't the same of the received file.

The `server` SHOULD also store the `Authorization` header/field value (decoded or not) for accountability purpose as this proves that the user with the unique pubkey did ask for the upload.

The `server` MAY reject the upload if the user is not authorized for any reason such as pending payment (Although payment flow is not strictly required. Server owners decide if the storage is free or not. Although we suggest [this freemium monetization scheme](#monetization))

The upload response is a json as follows:

```js
{
  nip96: {
    // SHA-256 hash. Empty string if unsuccessful
    x: "719171db19525d9d08dd69cb716a18158a249b7b3b3ec4bbdec5698dca104b7b",
  },
  errors: {
    // Empty array if successful
    nip96: ['error 1', 'error 2']
  }
}
```

`Clients` may upload the same file to one or many `servers`.
After successful upload, the `client` may optionally generate and send to any set of nostr `relays` a [NIP-94](94.md) event with atleast these tags (please read the included comments):

```js
[
  // Note we appended .png from the original uploaded file extension to the received `x` value
  // (it is optional but extremely recommended to add the extension as it will help nostr clients with detecting the file type by using regular expression)
  ["url", "https://server.domain/nip96/719171db19525d9d08dd69cb716a18158a249b7b3b3ec4bbdec5698dca104b7b.png"],
  ["x", "719171db19525d9d08dd69cb716a18158a249b7b3b3ec4bbdec5698dca104b7b"]
]
```

If the file upload was made to more than one `server`, `r` query params must be added to the url string, containing each of the `servers` used in **successful** upload operations. For example:

```js
[
  ["url", "https://server.domain/nip96/<sha256-file-hash>.png?r=server.domain2&r=server.domain3&r=server.domain4"],
  ["x", <the-hash>]
]
```

Alternativelly, instead of using NIP-94, the `client` can share or embbed on a nostr note just the above url, optionally with added [NIP-54](54.md) inline metadata such as a "magnet" field.

### File compression

File compression is optionally done at the `client`, **never on server**, before uploading.
This is done to assure the same file hash result, no matter to how many servers one may upload the same file.

## Download

`Servers` must make available the route path `/nip96/<sha256-file-hash>(.ext)` with `GET` method for file download.

Supporting ".ext", meaning "file extension", is required for `servers`. It is optional, although recommended, for `clients` to append it to the path.
When present it may be used by `servers` to know which `Content-Type` header to send (e.g.: "Content-Type": "image/png" for ".png" extension).
The file extension may be absent because the hash is the only needed string to uniquely identify a file.

`Clients` should send a `GET` request to the server url in the format `https://server.domain/nip96/<sha256-file-hash>.png?r=server.domain2&r=server.domain3`.

If the `server` doesn't have the file anymore, it MUST reply with a `302` HTTP redirect to the next `server` domain included as `r` query param. For example, issue a redirect to `https://server.domain2/nip96/<sha256-file-hash>.png?r=server.domain3`. The url used for the redirect SHOULD be limited to 3 `r` query params, so to avoid excessive number of redirects.

This redirect cooperation between `servers` is important to make a resource embedded by url in a note last longer.

### Image Transformations

`Servers` may respond to some image transformation query parameters and ignore those they don't support by serving
the original image file without transformations.

#### Resizing

Upon upload, `servers` may create resized image variants, such as thumbnails, respecting the original aspect ratio.
`Clients` may use the `w` query parameter to request an image version with the desired pixel width.
`Servers` can then serve the variant with the closest width to the parameter value
or an image variant generated on the fly.

Example: `https://server.domain/nip96/<sha256-file-hash>.png?r=server.domain2&r=server.domain3&w=32`

## Deletion

`Servers` must make available the route path `/nip96/<sha256-file-hash>(.ext)` with `DELETE` method for file deletion.
The extension is optional as the file hash is the only needed file identification.

`Clients` should send a `DELETE` request to the server url in the format `https://server.domain/nip96/<sha256-file-hash>.png`. It must include a NIP-98 `Authorization` header.

The `server` should reject deletes from users other than the original uploader. The `pubkey` encoded on the header value identifies the user.

It should be noted that more than one user may have uploaded the same file (so with the same hash). In this case, a delete must not really delete the file but just remove the user's `pubkey` from the file owners list.

The response is similar to the json sent on uploads.

## Monetization

This is an **optional** step that may be configured by `servers` at any moment.
It is a suggested way of monetizing the file storage.

It is a freemium business model, meaning that the file storage is free,
but it is expected that some users consuming the stored files may "zap" (send)
a variable amount of cryptocurrency to the server owner wallet.

Although file storage is free of charge, of course the `server` can delete files at any moment at its discrition.

For example, the file storage `server` may fetch [zap receipts](57.md#appendix-e-zap-receipt-event) from it's zap provider pubkey and
extract embeded media from referenced notes. Then stored files that hasn't received zaps
for a while may be deleted.

### Server Configuration

`Server` owners should configure their nostr pubkey at the `/.well-known/nostr.json?name=_` path as per [NIP-05](05.md#showing-just-the-domain-as-an-identifier), including `relay` information.

`Server` owners then should add to their nostr account metadata event (kind 0) a lud06 or lud16 field (and/or any future supported cryptocurrency address) pointing to a `zap-enabled` wallet address they own.

It is required to send the event to all relays included on previous NIP-05 configuration. We suggest re-sending the same event to said relays from time to time to make sure they don't get deleted.

### Client Implementation

`Clients` who make `zaps` available to their users are expected to try accessing the `/.well-known/nostr.json?name=_` path of all downloaded media domains (don't forget the domains on `r` query params) and, if available, get the zap related metadata (such as lud06 address).

Then they should cache this link between domains and zap-enabled pubkeys (or lack of). The individual cache entries should be renewed if too old.

When creating a nostr note with one or more embedded files from zap-enabled domain(s), the client should add the media domain pubkeys to [zap tags](57.md#appendix-g-zap-tag-on-other-events), along with the note author's pubkey.

If more than one wallet address is detected for a nostr note, zap splits can take place if Nostr Wallet Connect is configured by the user (as per [NIP-47](47.md)).

If NIP-47 isn't configured, one of the addresses may be randomly chosen to receive the zap,
which is statistically fair (it is better than expecting user to pay many invoices at once because it would be bad UX) or simply choose the address with higher zap split weight.
