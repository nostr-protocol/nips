Build Your Own Adventure
------------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP introduces `kind:296` and `kind:297` as text-based notes designed to create interactive stories. These notes include options for navigating to subsequent notes, allowing readers to continue exploring the story. `Kind:296` serves as the root event for the story, while `kind:297` represents individual scenes within the narrative.

The idea is to emulate "choose your own adventure" books, where each reader's journey through the story is unique.

Story events can include an optional `title` tag and multiple `option` tags that point to the next possible scenes.

Clients SHOULD render the options in a way that allows users to select and seamlessly navigate to the corresponding posts.

### Example for kind:296 (Root Scene)

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 296,
  "content": "<the beginning of the story>",
  "tags": [
    ["title", "<short title for this part of the story>"],

    ["option", "<description>", "<event_id>", "<relay_hint>"],
    ["option", "<description>", "<event_id>", "<relay_hint>"],
    // ...
  ]
}
```

### Example for kind:297 (Scene)

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 297,
  "content": "<continuation of the story>",
  "tags": [
    ["title", "<short title for this part of the story>"],

    ["option", "<description>", "<event_id>", "<relay_hint>"],
    ["option", "<description>", "<event_id>", "<relay_hint>"],
    // ...
  ]
}
```

The story concludes when no `option` tags are present.

The `.content` field SHOULD follow the same formatting rules as `kind:1`.
