Build Your Own Story
--------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines `kind:296` as a text note with options to navigate to the next text notes and continue reading. 

The idea is to replicate the dynamism of build your own adventure books, where each reader makes their own version of the story. 

## Story Section Events

Story Section events contain a `title` tag and `option` tags for the next sections.

Clients SHOULD render options in a way that users can select and move to that post.

The story ends when there are no `option`s available.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 296,
  "content": "<the story>",
  "tags": [
    ["title", "<short title for this part of the story>"],

    ["option", "<description>", "<event_id>", "<relay_hint>"],
    ["option", "<description>", "<event_id>", "<relay_hint>"],
    // ...
  ]
}
```

`.content` SHOULD use the same formatting rules as `kind:1`
