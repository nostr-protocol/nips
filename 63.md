NIP-63
======

Pre-authed Filters
------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP declares the use of event kind `33012` to represent one or more Nostr filters. 

The `d` tag represents the subscription id and the `filter` tag describes a (NIP-01)[01.md] filter. 

Supporting relays interpret the tags of this event as if they were submitted in the `REQ` scheme while automatically authenticating the signer. 

They are submitted to the relay via `EVENT` messages instead of the usual `REQ` message.

The goal is to be able to support `AUTH` from multiple users in the same connection while removing the usual `AUTH` round trip. 

```json
{
  "kind": 33012,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<subscription_id>"],
    ["filter", "<filters1>"],
    ["filter", "<filters2>"],
  ],
  "content": "",
  ...other fields
}
```
