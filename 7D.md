Threads
-------

`draft` `optional`

A thread is a `kind 11` event.  Threads SHOULD include a `title`.

```json
{
  "kind": 11,
  "content": "Good morning",
  "tags": [
    ["title", "GM"]
  ]
}
```

Replies to `kind 11` MUST use [NIP-22](./22.md) `kind 1111` comments. Replies should
always be to the root `kind 11` to avoid arbitrarily nested reply hierarchies.

```json
{
  "kind": 1111,
  "content": "Cool beans",
  "tags": [
    ["K", "11"],
    ["E", <event-id>, <relay-url>, <pubkey>]
  ]
}
```
