`window.nostr` offline message signature & verificiation
--------------------------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:b35363`

### Idea ðŸ’¡

The ability to sign and verify messages must be available clientside in order to have a proper implementation in the case where Users and Remote needs to be mutually verified.

The authentication between clients and relays can already be implemented with `nip-42` but this standard may lead to a **much simpler authentication** process where no Event has to be submitted on the network to verify authenticity.

### Nostr Implementation Possibility


> `nip-79` can be used standalone but it is intended to be a superset of `nip-07` it is therefore not recommended to use it without proper NIP-07 implementation.

The `window.nostr` object may be made available by web browsers or extensions and websites or web-apps may make use of it after checking its availability.

In order to sign and verify messages directly from the browser, the `window.nostr` object must define the following methods:

```
async window.nostr.signMessage(msg : string): string // returns sig string from nip-07 extension
async window.nostr.verifyMessage(sig: string, pubkey : string): boolean // takes a sig and a pubkey and verify message integrity
```
