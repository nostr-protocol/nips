Live Activities
---------------

`draft` `optional` `author:vitorpamplona`

## Abstract

Service providers want to offer statuses of live activities to the Nostr network in such a way that participants can be easily queried by clients. This NIP describes a general framework to advertise the involvement of pubkeys in such live activities.

# Live Event

A special event with kind `30311` "Live Event" is defined as a [NIP-33: Parameterized Replaceable Events](33.md) of public `p` tags. Each `p` tag SHOULD have a **displayable** marker name for the current role (e.g. `Host`, `Speaker`, `Participant`) of the user in the event. This event will be constantly updated as participants join and leave the activity.

For example:

```json
{
  "kind": 30311,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "nostr-dev-kit"],
    ["title", "<name of the event>"],
    ["summary", "<description>"],
    ["image", "<preview image url>"],
    ["t", "hashtag"]
    ["streaming", "<url>"],
    ["starts", "<unix timestamp in seconds>"],
    ["ends", "<unix timestamp in seconds>"],
    ["status", "<planned, live, ended>"],
    ["p", "91cf9..4e5ca", "wss://provider1.com/", "Host"],
    ["p", "14aeb..8dad4", "wss://provider2.com/nostr", "Speaker"],
    ["p", "612ae..e610f", "ws://provider3.com/ws", "Participant"]
  ],
  "content": "",
  ...other fields
}
```

A distinct `d` tag should be used for each activity. All other tags are optional.

Providers SHOULD keep the participant list small (e.g. under 1000 users) and, when limits are reached, Providers SHOULD select which participants get named in the event. Clients should not expect a comprehensive list. Once the activity ends, the event can be deleted or updated to summarize the activity. 

Interested clients are expected to listen to `"kind": 30311` events in general or for certain follow lists and statuses. Clients MAY display participants' roles in activities as well as access points to join the activity. If the user is participating in an activity, Clients can also display relevant information.

The activity MUST be linked to using the NIP-19 naddr code along with the "a" tag (see [NIP-33](33.md) and [NIP-19](19.md)).

# Use Cases

Common use cases include meeting rooms/workshops, watch-together activities, or event spaces, such as nostrnests.com
