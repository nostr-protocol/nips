# NIP-46 - Nostr Remote Signing

## Rationale

Private keys should be exposed to as few systems - apps, operating systems, devices - as possible as each system adds to the attack surface.

This NIP describes a method for 2-way communication between a remote signer and a Nostr client. The remote signer could be, for example, a hardware device dedicated to signing Nostr events, while the client is a normal Nostr client.

Currently, NIP-46 uses a JSON-RPC style flow where you pass encrypted commands in `kind:24133` events. This rewrite strives to remove as much of the JSON-RPC as possible and uses new event kinds that correspond to each command a client might send and the three types of responses that remote signers can send back.

This also allows us to incorporate [NIP-44](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/44.md) encryption in a way that doesn't break current NIP-46 implementations.

## Terminology

- **Local keypair**: A local public and private key-pair used to encrypt content and communicate with the remote signer.
- **Remote pubkey**: The public key that the user wants to sign as. The remote signer has control of the private key that matches this public key.

All pubkeys specified in this NIP are in hex format.

## Signer Discovery

To initiate a connection between a client and a remote signer there are a few different options.

### Direct connection initiated by remote signer

This is most common in a situation where you have your own nsecbunker or other type of remote signer and want to connect through a client that supports remote signing.

The remote signer would provide a connection token in the form:

```
bunker://<remote-pubkey>?relay=<wss://relay-to-connect-on>&relay=<wss://another-relay-to-connect-on>&secret=<optional-secret-value>
```

This token is pasted into the client by the user and the client then uses the details to connect to the remote signer via the specified relay(s).

### Direct connection initiated by the client

In this case, basically the opposite direction of the first case, the client provides a connection token (or encodes the token in a QR code) and the signer initiates a connection to the client via the specified relay(s).

```
nostrconnect://<local-keypair-pubkey>?relay=<wss://relay-to-connect-on>&metadata=<json metadata in the form: {"name":"...", "url": "...", "description": "..."}>
```

### Remote signer discovery via NIP-89

In this last case, most often used to fascilitate an OAuth-like signin flow, the client first looks for remote signers that have announced themselves via NIP-89 application handler events.

First the client will query for `kind: 31989` events that have a `k` tag of `24133` and/or any of the new request kinds detailed below.

These are generally shown to a user, and once the user selects which remote signer to use and provides the remote pubkey they want to use (via npub, pubkey, or nip-05 value), the client can initiate a connection. Note that it's on the user to select the remote signer that is actually managing the remote key that they would like to use in this case. If the remote pubkey is managed on another remote signer, the connection will fail.

In addition, it's important that clients validate that the pubkey of the announced remote signer matches the pubkey of the `_` entry in the `/.well-known/nostr.json` file of the remote signer's announced domain.

Clients that allow users to create new accounts should also consider validating the availability of a given username in the namespace of remote signer's domain by checking the `/.well-known/nostr.json` file for existing usernames. Clients can then show users feedback in the UI before sending a `create_account` event to the remote signer and receiving an error in return.

## The flow

### Client-side

1. Clients need two things to start: a local keypair and the pubkey that the user wants to use for signing events.
   - The local keypair is roughly disposable. E.g. - it's ok to store it locally (ideally encrypted) for some period of time. Once authenticated, remote signers can choose to trust this local keypair for a period of time. This local keypair can be deleted/rotated at will by the client and will only trigger a new auth challenge for the user.
   - The remote pubkey is the pubkey that the user is trying to sign in / sign as. This can be fetched with an NIP-05 or entered directly by the user.
2. Clients use the local keypair for encrypting request events that they send to remote signers.

### Remote signer-side

1. Remote signers manage the private key of the user that will be used for signing. There are many different remote signers out there (e.g. Nsecbunker, Amber, etc.) that operate in different ways and have different features.
2. Remote signers wait for request events and then act.

## Request Events `Multiple kinds`

Request events take the following form. In order simplify requests and payloads as much as possible, there are different event kinds for each command which help remote signers to understand the request and process the content properly.

Clients can subscribe to events of `kind: 24136`, `kind: 24137`, and `kind: 24138` that have an "e" tag containing the ID of their request event to listen for the response, auth_challenge, or error to their command.

```json
{
    "id": <id>,
    "kind": <kind for command>, // Each command has it's own kind
    "pubkey": <local keypair pubkey>,
    "content": <nip44(<request>)>,
    "tags": [["p", <remote pubkey>]],
    "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
}
```

## Auth Challenge Event `kind: 24137`

All requests / commands can potentially trigger an auth challenge, which is a special kind of repsonse event that tells the client that the user needs to provide a password or another form of authentication before the remote signer will process their request. The response content is always a URL that the client should display to the user. This URL is a page that is created/controlled by the remote signer in a way that allows the signer to collect the needed data before proceeding.

```json
{
    "id": <id>,
    "kind": 24137,
    "pubkey": <pubkey of the remote signer>,
    "content": <nip44(<auth_url>)>,
    "tags": [["p", <local keypair pubkey>], ["e", <id of the request event>]],
    "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
}
```

## Error Event `kind: 24138`

Error response (a separate kind in order to make errors easier to handle on the client side).
Content is NIP-44 encrypted string in the following format: `CODE: Error message text`. [Error codes](#error-codes) are detailed below.

```json
{
    "id": <id>,
    "kind": 24138,
    "pubkey": <pubkey of the remote signer>,
    "content": <nip44(<error>)>,
    "tags": [["p", <local keypair pubkey>], ["e", <id of the request event>]],
    "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
}
```

### Error Codes

- `UNAUTHORIZED`: Returned if the user fails the auth challenge.
- `NOT FOUND`: Returned if the remote signer doesn't have access to the remote pubkeys corresponding private key.
- `UNPROCESSABLE`: Returned if a request is malformed (e.g. incorrect request content).
- `OTHER`: Other error.
