NIP-101
=======

Descriptor Note
---------------

`draft` `optional`

A new event type "1101" which is a note to describe "stuff" in a human readable way.
"Stuff" here, is represented by an identifier (a descriptor if you will) which most likely would be the hash of a data object.

Each line of this note type will have a specific purpose.
The first line is dedicated for the point we want to describe (as mentioned above)
The second line is meant for making a human readable name for the identifier from the first line.
The third line is meant for a label, meaning a short, one-liner, description of the object behind the identifier.
The remaining of the note is for a multi-line description of the object we describe.

Example:
```
1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

order-number_12345

webshop order of a T-shirt

"This is awesome" T-shirt in size L.
Ordered from the webshop (order number 12345)
Remember to pack sticker freebies.
```

The Descriptor Note can be ported to a Nostr note using the existing tags.
For kind 1101 tag p,n,l stands for point, name and label. 
The multi-line description is kept in the content field.

Example:

```json
{"id":"905e339571caaabb57455fa33791a65d945d7371e2da81ff6aae923db8042ea0",

"content":"This is awesome T-shirt in size L.

"tags":[
["p", ‚Äù1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef],
["n", "order-number_12345"], 
["l", "webshop order of a T-shirt"],
]}
```

It is mandatory to fill out the point field; the three other fields are optional.
Making the describing fields optional on protocol level should make the descriptor note format useful for a broader set of applications.
On application level the user/developer can use and constraint the three fields as it fits in that particular application.
