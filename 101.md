Standard HTTP REST API for Relays
-------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:jacany`

This NIP defines the structure for a standard REST API to be implemented by relays. This is to ensure compatibility between different relay implementations and the clients accessing them.

## Reading Events

GET `/api/event`

Tags should be passed as query paramaters
`/api/req?ids=id1,id2,id3&authors=pk1&since=0`

Relays should return the events in a JSON array, not dissimilar from how it's done over websockets
```json
[
    event1,
    event2,
    event3,
    event4
]
```

## Publish Events

PUT `/api/event`

Clients should attach an `application/json` payload as an array containing events to publish.
```json
[
    event1,
    event2
]
```

Relays must verify the event's signature and it's JSON validity when the data is recieved.

Relays should return a `201 Created` if both checks pass the event is stored and processed, if not the server should return a `400 Bad Request` with a description of the error.
