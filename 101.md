# NIP-101: Decentralized Trust System for Nostr

## Abstract

This NIP proposes a **Decentralized Trust System** for the Nostr protocol, allowing users to enhance their social feed experience by filtering content based on trust ratings. The system mirrors real-world trust relationships, helping reduce spam, trolling, and misinformation without central control or opaque algorithms.

## Motivation

While Nostr's decentralized architecture empowers users, it also lacks a scalable, decentralized moderation mechanism. The current reliance on manual blocklists and follow lists is limited. This NIP introduces a trust-based model that enhances feed quality by prioritizing content from trusted individuals and networks.

## Specification

### 1. New Event Kind: `Trust Rating` (Kind 33)

A new event kind is introduced to facilitate trust ratings:

- **Event structure:**
```json
{
 "kind": 33,
 "content": {
"target_pubkey": "public key of the user being rated",
"rating": -100 to 100,
"related_event_id": "id of triggering event (optional)",
"category": "category of trust (optional)"
 },
 "pubkey": "public key of the rater",
 "tags": ["additional metadata or use cases"],
 "sig": "signature of the rater"
}
```

### 2. Trust Calculation (Client-Side)

Trust scores are calculated dynamically based on direct and indirect relationships:

- **Direct ratings:** The score provided directly by the user.
- **Indirect ratings:** Calculated using:

![](https://ipfs.copylaradio.com/ipfs/QmPtQxDk8pc8aGBwWNs38nTVP2Zg8Cb8Ag9s4xb35NtL93)


- **trust(A,B)**: Trust rating given by user ( A ) to ( B ).
- **trust(User,A)**: Trust rating given by the current User to ( A ).
- Negative ratings are ignored for indirect calculations.
- Trust is averaged if multiple paths exist between users.

Users can configure the depth of the trust network (friends, friends of friends, etc.) and thresholds for ratings.

### 3. Feed Filtering (Client-Side)

- Users define a trust threshold (e.g., -100 to 100) for displaying events.
- Content from users below the threshold is hidden by default, with an option to explore hidden content.

### 4. User Interface

Clients implementing this system should provide:
- **Trust/Distrust Buttons**: For rating users or content.
- **Trust Scores**: Displayed for users, configurable by category.
- **Import/Export Tools**: To manage trust lists.
- **Trust Network Visualization**: Interactive diagrams to understand trust relationships.

## Rationale

- **Decentralization:** Users manage their trust network without relying on centralized entities.
- **Transparency:** All ratings are public and verifiable.
- **Customization:** Each user can tailor their experience to their preferences.
- **Real-world analogy:** Mirrors trust in real-life relationships, fostering organic moderation.

## Compatibility

This system integrates seamlessly with existing Nostr clients by introducing a new event kind. Clients not implementing it will simply ignore Kind 33 events.

## Potential Applications

- **Spam Reduction:** Filter out spam and low-quality content.
- **Personalized Feeds:** Prioritize relevant and meaningful content.
- **Community Building:** Create shared trust networks for specific groups.
- **News Verification:** Utilize trusted entities for fact-checking and labeling.

## Security and Privacy

- **Integrity:** Trust ratings are signed by their authors, ensuring authenticity.
- **Public Nature:** Ratings are public by design. Users retain control over how they interpret and use these ratings.

## Advantages

- **Decentralized Moderation:** No central authority required.
- **Scalability:** The trust system grows organically with the network.
- **Resilience:** Hard for bad actors to manipulate due to multiple trust layers.

## Disadvantages

- **Echo Chambers:** Users might over-filter their feeds, reducing diversity.
- **Complexity:** Requires education to prevent misuse or bias-driven ratings.

## Alternatives

- **Blocklists:** Effective for basic use but lack flexibility for nuanced moderation.
- **Follow Lists:** Useful but limited for filtering unknown users.

This system enhances these approaches by creating an organic, decentralized trust network.

### Python Demo Code

```python
import math

def calculate_trust(user, friend_ratings, all_ratings):
trust_score = 0.0
num_raters = 0
for friend, direct_rating in friend_ratings.items():
if friend in all_ratings and user in all_ratings[friend]:
mutual_rating = all_ratings[friend][user]
if mutual_rating > 0:
trust_score += direct_rating * mutual_rating
num_raters += 1
return math.sqrt(trust_score / num_raters) if num_raters > 0 else 0.0

# Example:
all_ratings = {"A": {"B": 50, "C": 20}, "B": {"D": 100}, "C": {"D": 40}}
user = "D"
friend_ratings = {"B": 80, "C": 60}
print(calculate_trust(user, friend_ratings, all_ratings))
```

## Conclusion

This proposal introduces a decentralized, flexible, and user-driven trust system that empowers everyone on Nostr to take control of their social experience. By adopting this system, users can filter out spam, reduce misinformation, and engage in more meaningful conversationsâ€”without compromising the open and decentralized principles of the network.

We encourage developers, relay operators, and Nostr users to explore and implement this proposal. By participating, you can help shape a safer, more collaborative, and vibrant Nostr ecosystem. The more people adopt this trust system, the more powerful and refined the network becomes. Try it out and see how it transforms our experience on Nostr!
