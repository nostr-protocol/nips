# NIP-101 - Forms On Nostr

The nip provides a way to implement a feedback mechanism(forms) on nostr.

## Form Template - Public

Event `30168` describes a form as a parametrized replaceable event, with `field` tags that contain the description of each form field, with optional settings

```js
{
    "kind": 30168,
    "content" : ""
    "tags": [
      ["d", "<form identifier>"],
      ["name", "Name of the form"],
      ["settings", JSON.stringify({description: "<description of the form."})],
      ["field", "<fieldId>","<input-type>","<label for the field>","<Options (for option type)>", "<stringified JSON settings>"],
      ["field", "<fieldId>", "option", "label for options field",
        JSON.stringify([["<optionId1>", "option label", "<optionId2>", "option label"]]),
        "<stringified JSON settings>"
      ]
    ],
    "pubkey": "<Author of the form>"
}
```

The different tags used to detail the form are described as:

**d** - The unique identifier of a form, for a user

**name** - The name of the form`

**settings** - A form wide settings object, that can detail styles and visual representation of the form, certain fields in the object may be client specific

**field** - contains the description of a form field.

## Field Tag

A field tag is described as the following array:
`["field", FieldId, InputType, Label, Options, Field Settings ]`

**FieldId** - Is used to identify the field in the form, can be any alphanumeric string.

**InputType** - Can be one of: "text", "option", "label". All other types can be derived from the text type.

**Label** - Value that describes the field, can be a question the user needs feedback eg: "What is your age?"

**Options** - A stringified array of Options in case the user selected an option type.

**Field Settings** - A stringified JSON that may contain metadata about a field, like wether the field is a "required" field, has "prerequisites", or has UI directives like "textColor".

## Options

The options array is a stringified Array of Option Tags, where each option tag is
represented as:
`[<OptionId>, <label>, <optional config>]`

**OptionId** - Similar to FieldId it is an alphanumeric Id that serves as an identifier for that Id in the form.

**label** - A label describing the option.

**Optional Config** - metadata object holds information about the options like "prerequisites".

## Responses

Response events are events that are attached to a form(3068 kind event), and the response data is stored in a `kind: 1069` event

Response structure:

```json
{
  "kind": 1069,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "30168:<pubkey of the author>:<form identifier>"],
    [
      "response",
      "<FieldId>",
      "<response as string>",
      "<stringified metadata object>"
    ]
  ],
  "pubkey": "Author of Response"
}
```

The Response tag contains a "response" tag identifier "fieldId" the Id of the field as mentioned in the `kind:30168` event, response for the field as a string value, and a stringified metadata object.

for option fields, the response is the id of the option selected. In case of multiple-choice fields these id's maybe delimited by a semi-colon, ";", For example:

```json
{
  "kind": 1069,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "30168:<pubkey of the form author>:<formId>"],
    [
      "response",
      "<FieldId>",
      "ZCZC;XCZXCZ;Z34Z",
      "<stringified metadata object>"
    ]
  ],
  "pubkey": "Response author"
}
```

## Response Editability

if the form setting allows for editable responses. The latest timestamp event should be used to render the response.

## Access Control

Access control is managed by sending a set of 2 keys to users using gift wrap events as described in [nip-59](./59.md) but with a few modifications.

### Rumor

A kind:18 rumor is created that holds the keys in a "key" tag. An example event is:

```json
{
  "created_at": 1718188232,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    [
      "key",
      "026b71adbdc2fd168c17778311950c40afd33a7e08b4d3159f441cfe37a83882",
      "ca2f78e4fb0132232fbb673e4517498d2aa95d0cd2f9913d820a3fb91912c2d5"
    ]
  ],
  "kind": 18,
  "pubkey": "373a87e2c80114a4c15c422a5c3a59acf36ff383cb534d576aea6b08f8e58ee0",
  "id": "3e2f775af6867b2220bce59a5c2eacde3e2f405c7fc956af09939f7b02a60771"
}
```

### Seal

Works exactly as defined in [[59.md]]

### Wrap

The kind `1059` event also works similar to as described in [[59.md]] except that instead of referencing a users pubkey, we refer to an alias pubkey which is derived by hashing the form event information to the users pubkey as follows:

1. The hash function used is SHA256.
2. The input to the hash function is: `${30168}:${formAuthor}:${formId}:${userPub}`

**formAuthor** - The pubkey for the `kind:30168` event
**formId** - d-tag of the event
**userPub** - pubkey to recepient being given the access.

### Keys

The "key" tag in the `kind:18` rumor is represented as:
`["key", "<view key>", "<signing key>"]`

- **View Key** - A key which used to encrypt a form content, the view key can make the form viewable.

- **Signing Key** - The private key to the form event. Anybody with this key WILL BE ABLE TO EDIT THE FORM EVENT.

### Submit Access.

p-tags of the selected participants must be added to the form tags, and only query the responses from the p-tags mentioned in the form.

### Encrypted Responses.

Response tags are added to the `.content` field of the event and encrypted as per the spec in [nip-44](./44.md) by the responders private key and the form authors public key.

### Private Forms only viewable by a group.

Form fields and settings should be ommitted from the tags array and placed in the `.content` key, nip-44 encrypted by the corresponding public key of the view-key, and the signing key as private key. The selected responders can decrypt the form using the view key. The `tags` array is used to keep track of the allowed-responders identities.

```js
let encryptionKey = nip44.v2.utils.getConversationKey(
  bytesToHex(signingKey),
  getPublicKey(viewKey)
);
content = nip44.v2.encrypt(JSON.stringify(form), encryptionKey);
```

They view key is shared as a gift wrap to the participants as described above.

## Querying Form Template & Responses

form template maybe filtered using the form author's pubkey and the d-tag as follows

```js
const filter = {
  kinds: [30168],
  authors: [formIdPubkey],
  "#d": [formIdentifier],
};
```

Responses can be queried using the a-tag, and an optional authors tag depending the visibility of the form, for example

```js
const filter: Filter = {
  kinds: [1069],
  "#a": [`30168:${pubKey}:${formId}`],
};
if (allowedPubkeys) filter.authors = allowedPubkeys;
```

## Tradeoffs

- Alias pubkey on gift wrap means that there is no notification mechanism for the user, unless the user is expecting access to an event.
