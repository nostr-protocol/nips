NIP-101
=======

Descriptor Note
---------------

`draft` `optional`

A new event type "101" which is a note to describe "stuff" in a human readable way.
"Stuff" here, is represented by an identifier (descriptor if you will) which most likely would be the hash of a data object.

Each line of this note type will have a specific purpose.
The first line is dedicated for the point we want to describe (as mentioned above)
The second line is meant for making a human readable name for the identifier from the first line.
The third line is meant for a label, meaning a short, one-liner, description of the object behind the identifier.
The remaining of the note is for a multi-line description of the object we describe.

Example:
```
1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

order-number_12345

webshop order of a T-shirt

"This is awesome" T-shirt in size L.
Ordered from the webshop (order number 12345)
Remember to pack sticker freebies.
```

It is mandatory to fill out the point field; the three other fields are optional.
Making the describing fields optional on protocol level should make the descriptor note format useful for a broader set of applications.
On application level the user/developer can use and constraint the fields as it fits in that particular application.

All semantics regarding the descriptor note is in the note itself (by dedicating specific line numbers to specific fields).
Thereby we do not pollute the Nostr JSON document with extra meta data.
Hence we get more advanced functionality while keeping the Nostr note format itself clean and simple.
