Key Migration
-------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP offers a simple mechanism to socially evaluate and authenticate a key migration.

Users publish kind `39` events when migrating to a new key (`p` tag).

```yaml
{
  "kind": 39,
  "pubkey": "<main pubkey>", // The old/main public key
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<new pubkey>"] // The new public key
  ],
  content: "",
  // Other fields
}
```

Kind `39` events are either a legitimate migration and should be accepted, or a phishing attempt 
by an attacker, which should be rejected and the main key unfollowed.

[NIP-22](22.md) comments SHOULD be used to debate if the event is legitimate. [NIP-56](56.md) reports 
can be used to reveal malicious behavior. 

Clients SHOULD offer Web of Trust signals to help users make a decision.

Clients SHOULD emphasize off-line verification procedures when a kind `39` is found.

Clients MAY offer easy functions to switch the user's follow lists to the new public key and 
revert the transaction if necessary.
