Event Copy
----------

`draft` `optional` `author:arthurfranca`

An event of `kind 1006` is used to copy any event from another author (except other copies). A copy
allows its creator to keep content around even when the original gets deleted.

The `.content` of a copy event SHOULD be the stringified JSON of the whole original event,
optionally with extra fields inside a `.meta` key.
The `.content` MAY be empty to represent a deleted event.

The copy event's `created_at` field MUST be identical to the original one to keep same sort order.
A `copied_at` tag MAY be added as the moment of the copy.

The copy event SHOULD include the following tags so to make them queriable:

- Capital `I` tag with original event's `id`;
- Capital `P` tag with original event's `pubkey`;
- Capital `K` tag with original event's `kind`;
- All original event's single-letter tags.

`I`, `P` and `K` tags are reserved. They cannot be used by any other event kind.

## Use Cases

It is useful for any case one would benefit for owning someone else's event.

Clients can request both originals and copies to increase the chance of finding the events
they are interested in.

# Relay Event Re-publishing

It enables storing someone else's events while consuming one own event quota,
in case of relays that forbids different author event publishing.
The user can later delete it to free some quota.

# DM Inbox

The benefit comes from being able to soft-delete a received DM (by using a copy with empty `.content`),
making it possible to control one own inbox. Received DMs without copies may be considered unread.

# Group Moderation

A group admin may soft-delete events by using a copy with an empty content.
It can use a copy's `.meta.moderation.content` to take out curse words from the original content.
Clients should request group messages along with admin copies.
