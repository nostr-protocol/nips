Relationship Status
-------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:vitorpamplona`

## Abstract

Creates a replaceable event to privately assert the level of trust from the author to any other pubkey. 

The wise-spread use of these statuses between pubkeys is not ideal for Kind 3 or NIP-51 list structures. 

# Relationship Status Event

A special event with `kind:30382` "Relationship Status Event" is defined as a _parameterized replaceable event_ with a single `d` tag as the target pubkey. The other tags are stringified, NIP-44 encrypted and placed inside the `.content` of the event. 

For example:

```js
{
  "kind": 30382,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "612ae..e610f"],
  ],
  "content": "<NIP-44 encrypted Stringified TAG-List(
    ["status", "<Known Face, Contact, Following, Coworker, Friend, Partner, 
	          Family, Extended family, Trusted, Competitor, Traitor, Used to Know, 
			  Scammer, NSFW, Unkown, etc>"],
    ["nickname", "<My buddy>"]
    ["summary", "<Summary of the relationship>"],
  )",
  ...other fields
}
```

`status` MUST be a case-sensitive displayable category name with the expectation to group users by it. It is privately scoped and thus new statuses/groups are welcome.

`nickname` SHOULD be used instead of the person's display name in all interfaces

Profile screens MAY display the summary of the relationship and allow the user to change the tags of this event.

Clients MAY filter by `kind:30382` to determine how to assemble feeds, group messages, and when to display content.
