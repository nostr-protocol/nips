Private Relationship Status
---------------------------

`draft` `optional`

## Abstract

Creates a replaceable event using unbound lists to privately assert the level of trust from the author to any other pubkey. 

# Relationship Status Event

A new `kind:30382` event named "Relationship Status Event" is defined as a _parameterized replaceable event_ with a single `d` tag as hash of the target pubkey and `n` as the name for the list. The other tags are stringified, NIP-44 encrypted and placed inside the `.content` of the event. 

For example:

```js
{
  "kind": 30382,
  "tags": [
    ["d", bytesToHex(sha256(hexToBytes("<pubKey>")))],
    ["n", "Clients"]
  ],
  "content": "<NIP-44 encrypted Stringified TAG-List(
    ["p", "<pubkey>", "relay"]
    ["nickname", "<My buddy>"]
    ["summary", "<Summary of the relationship>"],
    ["nip92secret", "<secret used to decrypt medical data for this pubkey>"]
  )",
  ...other fields
}
```

`nickname` SHOULD be used instead of the person's display name in all interfaces

Profile screens MAY display the summary of the relationship and allow the user to change the tags of this event.

Clients MAY filter by `kind:30382`, with or without `n` tags, to determine how to assemble feeds, group messages, and when to display content.
