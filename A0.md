Voice Messages
-----------

**Status:** Draft

This NIP defines new events `kind: 1222` for root messages and `kind: 1244` for reply messages to be used for short voice messages, typically up to 60 seconds in length.

## Specification

### Event Kind `1222` and Kind `1244`

The `kind: 1222` event is defined as follows:

-   `content`: MUST be a URL pointing directly to an audio file.
    -   The audio file SHOULD be in `audio/mp4` (.m4a) format using AAC or Opus encoding. Clients MAY support other common audio formats like `audio/ogg`, `audio/webm`, or `audio/mpeg` (mp3), but `audio/mp4` is recommended for broad compatibility and efficiency.
    -   The audio duration SHOULD be no longer than 60 seconds. Clients publishing `kind: 1222` events SHOULD enforce this limit or provide a clear warning to the user if exceeded.
-   `tags`:
    -   Tags MAY be included as per other NIPs (e.g., `t` for hashtags, `g` for geohash, etc.).

  The `kind: 1244` event is defined as follows:
  
-    To be used for replies, `kind: 1244` events MUST follow the structure of `NIP-22`.
-   `content`: MUST be a URL pointing directly to an audio file.
    -   The audio file SHOULD be in `audio/mp4` (.m4a) format using AAC or Opus encoding. Clients MAY support other common audio formats like `audio/ogg`, `audio/webm`, or `audio/mpeg` (mp3), but `audio/mp4` is recommended for broad compatibility and efficiency.
    -   The audio duration SHOULD be no longer than 60 seconds. Clients publishing `kind: 1222` events SHOULD enforce this limit or provide a clear warning to the user if exceeded.
-   `tags`:
    -   Tags MAY be included as per other NIPs (e.g., `t` for hashtags, `g` for geohash, etc.).


## Visual representation with `imeta` (NIP-92) tag (optional)

The following imeta (NIP-92) tags MAY be included so clients can render a visual preview without having to download the audio file first:

- `waveform`: amplitude values over time, space separated, less than 100 values should be enough to render a nice visual
- `duration`: audio length in seconds
