Video Events
---------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines several new event kinds representing different types of video media. These events
are _parameterized replaceable_ as defined in [NIP-01](./01.md) and deletable per [NIP-09](09.md).

Unlike a `kind 1` event with a file attached, video events are intended to be surfaced in an video-specific context
rather than in a general micro-blogging context.

The following kinds are defined by this NIP:

- `31339` represents a video
- `31340` represents a short video

The following tags are required:

- `d` is a unique identifier randomly generated by the client.
- `imeta` is as described in [NIP 92](./92.md). Multiple `imeta` tags MAY be included to provide for different
  use cases (e.g. streaming vs download).
- `title` is the title of the video

The following tags are optional:

- `i` is an external GUID in the format defined [here](https://github.com/MerryOscar/nips/commit/280eb498e0ac56b8f9356c1b7a88cc8b31579801).
- `c` is the video's value as defined by a given category.
- `website` is an external url to a website related to the video.
- `duration` is the duration of the video, in seconds.
- `published_at` is a timestamp representing the video's original publish date.

Note that actors, directors, etc., SHOULD be referred to using both a plaintext `c` tag AND a conventional `p` tag when pubkey is available. When doing so, the `p` tag's petname MUST be the same as the `c` tag's value. In this way `c` tags can be used to indicate category, as well as actor, producer, etc.

`content` SHOULD be summary or description of the video.

Example:

```json
{
  "id": <event_id>,
  "pubkey": <author_pubkey>,
  "created_at": <created_at>,
  "kind": 31340,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<id>"],
    ["c", "Lifestyle", "category"],
    ["c", "Jcubw", "actor"],
    ["i", "youtube:shorts:UCgsfbwuLfU"],
    ["p", "2a07724d42fd8004b5c97b62ba03b6baf3919f9e8211667039987866997e97ad", "wss://my-relay.com", "Jcubw"],
    ["title", "75 FOOT CLIFF DIVE ðŸ˜¨"],
    ["published_at", "<published_at>"],
    ["imeta", "url https://example.com/my-track.mp4 x <hash> ..."]
  ]
}
```
