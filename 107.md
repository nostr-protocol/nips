Wrapper Event
-------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:ungigdu`

A wrapper event is a kind `1107` event that carries another vaild event in its `content` field. The content is encrypted using the same way that [NIP-04](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/04.md) specifies. The `tags` MUST contain an entry identifying the receiver of the message.

## Motivation

Sometimes a client may not want to publish an event by itself after signing it. In such cases, the client can "wrap" this event into a wrapper event and let a designated receiver publish it instead.



## Some use cases

- `Scheduled Event`: A scheduled event can be created by wrapping an event that has a future created_at timestamp. This wrapper event can then be sent to a publishing bot for later inner event publishing.
- `Burn after Reading`: A client can send a kind-4 DM (Direct Message) event along with a wrapper event that contains the kind-5 delete event for this DM. The delete event SHOULD be published by the receiver client after reading the DM.
