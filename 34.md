Relay Supported Features
------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:Semisol`

This NIP adds a field to the NIP-11 relay information document, `supported_features`, which is an array of strings containing a list of supported features.  
Each supported feature must be a string that is named similar to Java packages (`com.example.ExampleFeature`) or `nip#.*` where `#` is replaced by a NIP number.
