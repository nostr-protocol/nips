NIP-43
======

Shared Key DM
-------------

`draft` `optional`

This direct message (DM) scheme between two participants aims to hide metadata while keeping the regular client-relay filtering experience.

## Chat Request

A `kind:1043` "Chat Request" event is sent from user A to B. If user A has sent a considerable amount of messages with no reply from user B,
it can send to B another "Chat Request" event.

The chat request uses a random pubkey to hide who's the requester. It wraps an encrypted `kind:30044` "Pubkey Owner Proof" event
signed by user A's privkey, proving it owns the key as long as the event has a `created_at` not too far in the past.

The inner event is a parameterized replaceable one with no `d` tag to make it hard to be accepted by relays if the receiver tries to publish it.
It has an empty `.content` so that it has little value for spammers (there is no attached message to show to the receiver).

```js
{
  "kind": 1043,
  "pubkey": "<random>",
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<pubkey-B>"]
  ]
  "content": "<nip44Encrypt(JSON.stringify({
    "kind": 30044,
    "pubkey": "<pubkey-A>",
    "tags": [], // No "d" tag
    "content": "",
    "created_at": 1702711000 // now
    // ...other fields
  }))>",
  "created_at": 1702711000 // now
  // ...other fields
}
```

## Active Chats

When receiving a chat request from user A, an user B can accept it or ignore it.
The user accepts it by adding the sender's pubkey to its `kind:10043` "Active Chat" event's list of encrypted `p` tags.

B's client should auto accept it if A is one of its follows or contact. Else
the client should show A's `kind:0` metadata and link to its profile to help with B decision.

When sending a chat request, the sender auto adds the receiver's pubkey to its own "Active Chat" event.

```js
{
  "kind": 10043,
  "pubkey": "<pubkey-B>"
  "content": "<nip44Encrypt(JSON.stringify([
    ["p", "<pubkey-A>"],
    // other "p" tags
  ]))>",
  // ...other fields
}
```

## Direct Message

After sending a chat request and updating its own active chats, user A is able to send `kind:14` Shared Key DM events
even though it doesn't know if B will ever fetch and read them.

Both A and B use their [NIP-44](44.md) "Conversation Key" they have in common as a private key to sign a [NIP-59](59.md) `kind:1059` wrapper event
(with `kind:13` seal). It wraps the encrypted DM event authored by the real user's pubkey.

The "Conversation Key" is used to encrypt the inner events.

There is no `p` tag on the wrapper event because the two participants will fetch messages by the pubkey derived from the "Conversation Key".
This way no spam can be sent to any of the participants and the new messages download is finished faster.

The correct current date is used on the wrapper event.

The inner `kind:14` event MUST NOT include a `.sig` field to avoid it being published to relays.

```js
{
  "kind": 1059, // gift wrap
  "pubkey": "<random>",
  "tags": []
  "content": "<nip44Encrypt(JSON.stringify({
    "kind": 13, // seal
    "pubkey" "<pubkey-A>",
    "tags": [],
    "content": "<nip44Encrypt(JSON.stringify({
      "kind": 14, // DM
      "pubkey" "<pubkey-A>",
      "tags": [],
      "content": "Hello, User B",
      "created_at": 1702711000 // now
      // ....other fields without .sig
    }))>",
    "created_at": 0
    // ....other fields
  }))>",
  "created_at": 1702711000 // now
  // ...other fields
}
```
