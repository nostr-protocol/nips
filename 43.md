Fast Authentication
-------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:arthurfranca`

This is a `client` to `relay` authentication procedure that
happens on connection start by using an `authorization` query parameter.
For example:

`new WebSocket("wss://relay.url?authorization=...")`

## Motivation

`Relays` may want to grant access to specific resources just to authenticated users.

For that, both `clients` and `relays` need to implement authentication. A simple authentication
procedure that `clients` can easily implement (just a query parameter) is better for driving adoption.

## When Clients Authenticate

The `client` should check for [NIP-11](11.md) `relay` document's `"supported_nips"` field in search for NIP-43 support.
If there is support or the document is unavailable, the `client` should connect to the `relay` using NIP-43.
Otherwise, the `client` may choose to connect without NIP-43.

## How Clients Authenticate

The `client` must generate a `kind: 22242` ephemeral event with the current time as `created_at`
and the relay url as a `relay` tag.
Then it has to stringify the JSON event and [percent-encode](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#page-12) it.
The resulting string is used as `authorization` query param when connecting to the relay.

### Javascript Example

```js
  const relayUrl = 'wss://relay.example.com'
  // add id and signature as usual
  const jsonEvent = generateNostrEvent({
    pubkey: "...",
    created_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
    kind: 22242,
    tags: [['relay', relayUrl]],
    content: ""
  })
  const auth = window.encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(jsonEvent))
  const ws = new WebSocket(`${relayUrl}?authorization=${auth}`)
  ws.addEventListener('open', () => console.log('auth accepted'))
  ws.addEventListener('close', () => console.log('disconnected') )
```

## How Relay Handles Authentication

`Relays` authenticate users with valid `authorization` query param.

The `authorization` query param must be percent-decoded into a nostr event that must:
- be of `kind` `22242`;
- have `created_at` within a small time window relative to the current date (e.g. 60 seconds);
- have the `relay` tag url value with the same hostname, port and path as the connected `relay`.

## Security Measures

The used protocol should be `wss` (WebSocket Secure).

Although not required, the authorization event `id` can be stored by the `relay`
for the same above mentioned time window so that
if the same event `id` is used twice, the `relay` should reject the connection and
also disconnect the user that first used the event to authenticate.
