NIP-43
======

Shared Key DM
-------------

`draft` `optional`

This direct message (DM) scheme between two participants aims to hide metadata while keeping the regular client-relay filtering experience.

## Chat Request

When an user sends a message to someone for the first time, a `kind:1043` "Chat Request" event is sent from user A to B,
followed by the DM itself.

If user A has never received a reply DM from B after some time,
or a new DM from user A was sent after a long period of chat inactivity,
user A's client may send another "Chat Request" event to B just in case a previous chat request was missed
due to being mixed with a lot of other chat requests by different people.

The chat request uses a random pubkey to hide who's the requester. It wraps an encrypted `kind:30043` "Pubkey Owner Proof" event
signed by user A's privkey, proving it owns the key as long as the event has a `created_at` not too far in the past.

The inner event is a parameterized replaceable one with no `d` tag to make it hard to be accepted by relays if the receiver tries to publish it.
It has a `p` tag with the receiver pubkey to make it focused to this specific interaction, to avoid its reuse.
It has an empty `.content` so that it has little value for spammers (there is no attached message to show to the receiver).

This event should be sent to atleast one of the receiver's [NIP-65](65.md) `read` relays.

```js
{
  "kind": 1043,
  "pubkey": "<random-pubkey>",
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<pubkey-B>"]
  ]
  "content": "<nip44Encrypt(JSON.stringify({
    "kind": 30043,
    "pubkey": "<pubkey-A>",
     // No "d" tag
    "tags": [
      ["p", "<pubkey-B>"]
    ],
    "content": "",
    "created_at": 1702711000 // now
    // ...other fields
  }))>",
  "created_at": 1702711000 // now
  // ...other fields
}
```

## Active Chats

When receiving a chat request from user A, an user B can accept it or ignore it.
The user accepts it by adding the sender's pubkey to its `kind:10043` "Active Chat" event's list of encrypted `p` tags.

B's client should auto accept it if A is one of its follows or contact. Else
the client should show A's `kind:0` metadata and link to its profile to help with B decision.

When sending a chat request, the sender auto adds the receiver's pubkey to its own "Active Chats" event.

The user should publish the event to all of its [NIP-65](65.md) `write` relays.

```js
{
  "kind": 10043,
  "pubkey": "<pubkey-B>"
  "content": "<nip44Encrypt(JSON.stringify([
    ["p", "<pubkey-A>"],
    // other "p" tags
  ]))>",
  // ...other fields
}
```

## Direct Message

After sending a chat request and updating its own active chats, user A is able to send `kind:14` Shared Key DM events
even though it doesn't know if B will ever fetch and read them.

Both A and B use their [NIP-44](44.md) "Conversation Key" they have in common as a private key to sign a [NIP-59](59.md) `kind:1059` wrapper event
(with `kind:13` seal). It wraps the encrypted DM event authored by the real user's pubkey.

The "Conversation Key" is used to encrypt the inner events.

The wrapper event has a random pubkey on the `p` tag just to look like a regular gift wrap.
In reality the two participants will fetch messages by `author`, using the pubkey derived from the "Conversation Key".
This way no fake events can be sent to any of the participants to flood them with a DoS attack and the new messages set is downloaded quicker.

The correct current date is used on the wrapper event.

The inner `kind:14` event MUST NOT include a `.sig` field to avoid it being published to relays.

```js
{
  "kind": 1059, // gift wrap
  "pubkey": "<conversation-key-AB-derived-pubkey>",
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<random-pubkey>"] // just to look like a regular gift wrap
  ],
  "content": "<nip44Encrypt(JSON.stringify({
    "kind": 13, // seal
    "pubkey" "<pubkey-A>",
    "tags": [],
    "content": "<nip44Encrypt(JSON.stringify({
      "kind": 14, // DM
      "pubkey" "<pubkey-A>",
      "tags": [],
      "content": "Hello, User B",
      "created_at": 1702711000 // now
      // ....other fields without .sig
    }))>",
    "created_at": 0
    // ....other fields
  }))>",
  "created_at": 1702711000 // now
  // ...other fields
}
```

This event should be sent to atleast one of the receiver's [NIP-65](65.md) `read` relays and also to one or more of the sender's `read` relays.
This way, an user will only have to fetch DMs from its own set of `read` relays.
