Nostr Coinjoin Discovery
---------------------------------------

`draft` `author:kukks`

## Introduction
The BTCPay Server Coinjoin plugin offers a coinjoin endpoint discovery feature over Nostr for a coordinator runner and a coinjoin client to easily discover each other.


## Specification
This NIP introduces a NIP16 replaceable kind `15750`, with the following tags:
* `type`: Signals what kind of coinjoin protocol is being provided. In the case of the BTCPay Server coinjoin plugin, this is `wabisabi`. Other possible options could be `whirlpool`, `bip78`, `joinmarket`, etc.
* `network`: Signals the bitcoin network the coinjoin protocol is operating on. Always lowercase, can be `mainnet`,`testnet`, `signet`, `regtest`.
* `endpoint`: A URI of where a user may connect to interact with the coinjoin.

The content of the event COULD be used to describe the coinjoin endpoint, such as fees, round parameters, etc.

As a client, you SHOULD check that the event was created within the last 15 minutes, to ensure that the coinjoin endpoint is still active.
As a coinjoin endpoint provider, you SHOULD update the event every 15 minutes to signal you are still online.
