NIP-54
======

Wiki
----

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines `kind:30818` (an _addressable event_) for descriptions (or encyclopedia entries) of particular subjects, and it's expected that multiple people will write articles about the exact same subjects, with either small variations or completely independent content.

Articles are identified by lowercase, normalized ascii `d` tags.

## Articles
```json
{
  "content": "A wiki is a hypertext publication collaboratively edited and managed by its own audience.",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "wiki"],
    ["title", "Wiki"],
  ]
}
```

## `d` tag normalization rules

- Any non-letter character MUST be converted to a `-`.
- All letters MUST be converted to lowercase.

## Content

The `content` should be [Djot](https://djot.net/) with two special functionalities:

1. Links can have target URIs in NIP-21 format, like `[bob](nostr:npub1bob4npub4here4qwxek)`.
2. When a reference can't be found for a "Reference"-style link should link to the wiki article with that name instead, like a "wikilink". For example:

> a tree is a [vegetable][] that grows big.
>
> trees are often [green][green color], but they can also be [red][red color] as [bob][] says.
>
> [bob]: nostr:npub1bob4npub4here4qwxek

In the article above, "vegetable" will link to the wiki article **"vegetable"** (with a `d` tag set to `"vegetable"`), "green" will link to the article **green color** (with `d` set to `"green-color"`), same for "red". But "bob" will link to the specified npub as in the reference.

## Optional extra tags

  - `title`: for when the display title should be different from the `d` tag.
  - `summary`: for display in lists.
  - `a` and `e`: for referencing the original event a wiki article was forked from.

## Merge Requests

Event `kind:818` represents a request to merge from a forked article into the source. It is directed to a pubkey and references the original article and the modified event.

[INSERT EVENT EXAMPLE]

## Redirects

Event `kind:30819` is also defined to stand for "wiki redirects", i.e. if one thinks `Shell structure` should redirect to `Thin-shell structure` they can issue one of these events instead of replicating the content. These events can be used for automatically redirecting between articles on a client, but also for generating crowdsourced "disambiguation" pages ([common in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Disambiguation)).

## How to decide what article to display

As there could be many articles for each given name, some kind of prioritization must be done by clients. Criteria for this should vary between users and clients, but some means that can be used are described below:

### Reactions

[NIP-25](25.md) reactions are very simple and can be used to create a simple web-of-trust between wiki article writers and their content. While just counting a raw number of "likes" is unproductive, reacting to any wiki article event with a `+` can be interpreted as a recommendation for that article specifically and a partial recommendation of the author of that article. When 2 or 3-level deep recommendations are followed, suddenly a big part of all the articles may have some form of tagging.

### Relays

[NIP-51](51.md) lists of relays can be created with the kind 10102 and then used by wiki clients in order to determine where to query articles first and to rank these differently in relation to other events fetched from other relays.

### Contact lists

[NIP-02](02.md) contact lists can form the basis of a recommendation system that is then expanded with relay lists and reaction lists through nested queries. These lists form a good starting point only because they are so widespread.

### Wiki-related contact lists

[NIP-51](51.md) lists can also be used to create a list of users that are trusted only in the context of wiki authorship or wiki curationship.

## Forks
Wiki-events can tag other wiki-events with a `fork` marker to specify that this event came from a different version. Both `a` and `e` tags SHOULD be used and have the `fork` marker applied, to identify the exact version it was forked from.

## Deference
Wiki-events can tag other wiki-events with a `defer` marker to indicate that it considers someone else's entry as a "better" version of itself. If using a `defer` marker both `a` and `e` tags SHOULD be used.

This is a stronger signal of trust than a `+` reaction.

This marker is useful when a user edits someone else's entry; if the original author includes the editor's changes and the editor doesn't want to keep/maintain an independent version, the `link` tag could effectively be a considered a "deletion" of the editor's version and putting that pubkey's WoT weight behind the original author's version.

## Why Djot?

Wikitext is unimplementable. Markdown and Asciidoc do not have strict specs. In Markdown every implementation has its own set of special functionalities that would cause conflict and protocol bloat, also it lacks standardized features that are good to have on encyclopaedias: subscript, superscript, description lists, math, comments and custom labeled blocks. Asciidoc, on the other hand, has all features under the sun, but its spec is so huge no one has ever implemented it, not even in JavaScript (the canonical JavaScript library that most people use is transpiled from the original in Ruby).

Djot is a much faster parser, made by John MacFarlane (the guy behind Pandoc) with years of experience and lessons learned behind him. The spec is well-defined and simple, and has all the features listed above, while also being basically the same as the most basic Markdown.

## Appendix 1: Merge requests
Users can request other users to get their entries merged into someone else's entry by creating a `kind:818` event.

```json
{
  "content": "I added information about how to make hot ice-creams",
  "kind": 818,
  "tags": [
    [ "a", "30818:<destination-pubkey>:hot-ice-creams", "<relay-url>" ],
    [ "e", "<version-against-which-the-modification-was-made>", "<relay-url>" ],
    [ "p", "<destination-pubkey>" ],
    [ "e", "<version-to-be-merged>", "<relay-url>", "source" ]
  ]
}
```

`.content`: an optional explanation detailing why this merge is being requested.
`a` tag: tag of the article which should be modified (i.e. the target of this merge request).
`e` tag: optional version of the article in which this modifications is based
`e` tag with `source` marker: the ID of the event that should be merged. This event id MUST be of a `kind:30818` as defined in this NIP.

The destination-pubkey is the pubkey being requested to merge something into their article can create [[NIP-25]] reactions that tag the `kind:818` event with `+` or `-`
