NIP-51

Lists
-----

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines lists of things that users can create. Lists can contain references to anything, and these references can be **public** or **private**.

Public items in a list are specified in the event `tags` array, while private items are specified in a JSON array that mimics the structure of the event `tags` array, but stringified and encrypted using the same scheme from [NIP-44](44.md) (the shared key is computed using the author's public and private key) and stored in the `.content`. An earlier version of this specification used [NIP-04](04.md) for encryptions. Those are now deprecated. For backward compatibility, Clients can automatically discover if the encryption is NIP-04 or NIP-44 by searching for "iv" in the ciphertext and decrypting accordingly.

When new items are added to an existing list, clients SHOULD append them to the end of the list, so they are stored in chronological order.

## Types of lists

### Standard lists

Standard lists use normal replaceable events, meaning users may only have a single list of each kind. They have special meaning and clients may rely on them to augment a user's profile or browsing experience.

For example, _mute list_ can contain the public keys of spammers and bad actors users don't want to see in their feeds or receive annoying notifications from.

### Sets

Sets are lists with well-defined meaning that can enhance the functionality and the UI of clients that rely on them. Unlike standard lists, users are expected to have more than one set of each kind, therefore each of them must be assigned a different `"d"` identifier.

For example, _relay sets_ can be displayed in a dropdown UI to give users the option to switch to which relays they will publish an event or from which relays they will read the replies to an event; _curation sets_ can be used by apps to showcase curations made by others tagged to different topics.

Aside from their main identifier, the `"d"` tag, sets can optionally have a `"title"`, an `"image"` and a `"description"` tags that can be used to enhance their UI.

Some clients have used these lists in the past, but they should work on transitioning to the [standard formats](#standard-lists) above.
