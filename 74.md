Addressable Chat
----------------

`draft` `optional`

Every time an addressable event (kinds 30000-39999) contains a `"relays"` tag with any number of relay URLs specified in it (`["relays", "wss://myrelay.com", "wss://addressable.chat"]`) clients have the option of toggling a chat box about the topic of that event.

Chat messages are expected to be read and published from and to the specified relays, which will _somehow_ provide moderation and consistency.

(Clients can also use different relays other than those specified by the addressable event author, but this would be a power/optional/manual feature until other means of signaling this are invented.)

### Chat Message

Chat messages must have `kind:1311`. Clients MUST include the `a` tag of the activity with a `root` marker. Other Kind-1 tags such as `reply` and `mention` can also be used. An `e` tag containing the specific ID of the current addressable event version being replied to SHOULD also be included.

```json
{
  "kind": 1311,
  "tags": [
    ["a", "<addressable-event-kind>:<addressable-author-pubkey>:<d-identifier>", "<optional relay url>", "root"],
    ["e", "<addressable-event-id>", "<optional relay url>", "root"]
  ],
  "content": "hello fans of this article",
  ...
}
```
