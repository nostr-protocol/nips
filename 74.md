Proxy and Broadcasting Relay Lists
----------------------------------

`draft` `optional`

Kind `10017` indicates the user's preferred relays for proxy downloads. Such services save the user's bandwidth by utilizing a single connection to a proxy relay which reaches out to all of the other relays. 

Kind `10018` indicates the user's preferred relays for broadcasting relays. Such services improve the user's privacy by utilizing a broadcasting relay to distribute an event to all of the appropriate relays without requiring the user to connect with each of those relays.

Both events MUST include a list of `relay` URLs in private tags. Private tags are JSON Stringified, NIP-44-encrypted to the signer's keys and placed inside the `.content` of the event.

```js
{
  "kind": 10017,
  "tags": [],
  "content": nip44Encrypt(JSON.stringify([
    ["relay", "wss://myproxy.relay.com"]
  ]))
  //...other fields
}
```

```js
{
  "kind": 10018,
  "tags": [],
  "content": nip44Encrypt(JSON.stringify([
    ["relay", "wss://mybroadcaster.relay.com"]
  ]))
  //...other fields
}
```

Clients SHOULD use proxy relays to download events before using it's native event-finding method.

Clients SHOULD use broadcasting relays instead of the Client's own event publishing algorithms. 

Clients SHOULD publish kind `10017` and `10018` events to the author's [NIP-65](65.md) `write` relays.
