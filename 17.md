Private Direct Messages and Group DMs
-------------------------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP establishes an encrypted direct messaging scheme for 2+ participants using [NIP-44](44.md) encryption and [NIP-59](59.md) seals and gift wraps. 

It offers the following privacy and security features: 

1. **No Metadata Leak**: Participant identities, each message's real date and time, event kinds, and other event tags are all hidden from the public. Senders and receivers cannot be linked with public information alone.
2. **No Public Group Identifiers**: There is no central queue, channel or otherwise converging identifier to correlate or count all messages in the same group. 
3. **No Moderation**: There are no group admins: no invitations or bans.
4. **No Shared Secrets**: There are no secret that must be known to all members to leak or be mistakenly shared
5. **Fully Recoverable**: Messages can be fully recoverable by any client with the receiver or the sender's private key
6. **Optional Forward Secrecy**: Users and clients can opt-in for "disappearing messages" that are not recoverable with their private key
7. **Uses Public Relays**: Messages can flow through public relays without loss of privacy. Private relays can increase privacy further, but they are not required.
8. **Cold Storage**: Users can unilaterally opt-in to sharing their messages with a separate key that is exclusive for DM backup and recovery.

## 1. The Direct Message

A new `kind:14` defines a message between 2+ users (i.e. `pubkey` + `p`-tags). 

It is designed to be a Rumor in [NIP-59](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/716/files) and thus MUST never be signed. If it is signed, the message becomes **fully public**. This event kind requires the rest of this protocol to make it private. 

```js
{
  "pubkey": "<sender-key-in-hex>",
  "kind": 14,
  "tags": [ 
    ["p", "<receiver-1-key-in-hex>", "<relay-url>"],
    ["p", "<receiver-2-key-in-hex>", "<relay-url>"],
    ["e", "<kind-14-id-in-hex>", "<relay-url>", "reply"]
	["subject", "<conversation-title>"],
    ...
  ],
  "content": "<message-in-plain-text>",
  ...
}
```

The set of `pubkey` + `p` tags define a Group. Clients SHOULD render messages of the same group in a continuous thread. If a new `p` tag is added or current one is removed, a new group is created. 

An optional `subject` tag defines the current name/topic of the conversation. Any member can change the topic by simply submitting a new `subject` to an existing `pubkey` + `p`-tags group. There is no need to send `subject` in every message. The newest `subject` in the thread is the subject of the conversation. 

The use of other tags is highly encouraged (e.g. `content-warning` ([NIP-36](36.md)) if the content is NSFW). 

## 2. The Seal

`kind:13` encrypts and signs the message. It wraps the **unsigned** `kind:14` event and is signed with the sender's key. 

```js
{
  "pubkey": "<sender-key-in-hex>",
  "kind": 13,
  "created_at": <random-time-up-to-1-week-in-past>, 
  "tags": [],  
  "content": "<nip-44-encrypted-kind-14>",
  "sig": "<signed-by-sender-key>"
}
```

The sealed rumor is **always** encrypted to **each** receiver's pubkey but **no** `p`-tag pointing to the receiver is used. The receiver's information MUST not be public. The only public information in this event is the sender's pubkey. 

Clients MUST verify if pubkey of the `kind:13` is the pubkey on the `kind:14`, otherwise any sender can impersonate others by simply changing the pubkey on `kind:14`.

Clients SHOULD randomize `created_at` in up to a week in the past to make sure grouping by `created_at` doesn't reveal the group's membership information. 

Tags MUST always be empty. The inner `kind:14` event MUST always be unsigned. The encryption algorithm MUST use [NIP-44](44.md). 

## 3. The Gift Wrap
 
A gift wrap event (`kind:1059`) wraps `kind:13` to hide the sender from public view. The only public information in this event is the receiver's key. 

```js
{
  "pubkey": "<random-key-in-hex>",
  "kind": 1059,
  "created_at": <random-time-up-to-1-week-in-past>,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<receiver-1-key-in-hex>", "<relay-url>"]
  ],
  "content": "<nip-44-encrypted-kind-13>",
  "sig": "<signed-by-random-key>"
}
```

The `p` tag for the recipient MUST be used. It can be the user's main pubkey or an alias key created to receive DMs without exposing the receiver.

Clients SHOULD randomize `created_at` in up to a week in the past to make sure grouping by `created_at` doesn't reveal the group's membership information. 
 
## 4. Complete Algorithm

To send a message:

1. Create an unsigned `kind:14` event with the message in its `.content` and `p`-tags to one or more receivers. 

Then for each receiver + sender: 

1. Encrypt the serialized `Kind:14` to the receiver's public key using [NIP-44](44.md). 
2. Seal it with a `kind:13` event, signed by the sender's main key. 
3. Create a new key
5. Encrypt the Seal into a `kind:1059` GiftWrap with a tag to the receiver using [NIP-44](44.md)
6. Sign the event with the new random key
7. Broadcast the `kind:1059` event to the relays of the receiver
8. Delete all other events

When possible, Clients SHOULD only broadcast wrapped events to the `read` relays of each recipient's [NIP-65](65.md).

## 6. Example

This example sends the message `Hola, que tal?` from `nsec1w8udu59ydjvedgs3yv5qccshcj8k05fh3l60k9x57asjrqdpa00qkmr89m` to `nsec12ywtkplvyq5t6twdqwwygavp5lm4fhuang89c943nf2z92eez43szvn4dt`. The two final GiftWraps are:
