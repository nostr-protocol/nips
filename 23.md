NIP-23
======

Long-form Content
-----------------

`draft` `optional` `author:fiatjaf`

This NIP defines `kind:30023` (a parameterized replaceable event according to NIP-33) for long-form text content, generally referred to as "articles" or "blog posts".

"Social" clients that deal primarily with `kind:1` notes should not be expected to implement this NIP.

### Format

The `.content` of these events should be a string text in Markdown syntax.

### Metadata

For the date of the last update the `.created_at` field should be used, for "tags"/"hashtags" (i.e. topics about which the event might be of relevance) the `"t"` event tag should be used, as per NIP-12.

Other metadata fields can be added as tags to the event as necessary. Here we standardize 4 that may be useful, although they remain strictly optional:

- `"title"`, for the article title
- `"image"`, for a URL pointing to an image to be shown along with the title
- `"summary"`, for the article summary
- `"published_at"`, for the timestamp in unix seconds (stringified) of the first time the article was published

### Editability

These articles are meant to be editable, so they should make use of the replaceability feature of NIP-33 and include a `"d"` tag with an identifier for the article. Clients should take care to only publish and read these events from relays that implement that. If they don't do that they should also take care to hide old versions of the same article they may receive.

### Linking

The article may be linked to using the NIP-19 `nitem` code along with the `"i"` tag (see NIP-33 and NIP-19).

### References

Writing clients should implement support for parsing pasted NIP-19 `nitem` identifiers and adding them automatically to the list of `.tags` of the event, replacing the actual content with a string like `#[tag_index]` in the same way as NIP-08 -- or, if the reference is in the form of a URL (for example, `[click here](nitem1...)`) then they should be replaced with just the tag number directly as if link with that name existed at the bottom of the Markdown (for example, `[click here][0]`).

Reader clients should parse the Markdown and replace these references with either internal links so the referenced events can be accessed directly, with NIP-21 `nostr:nitem1...` links or direct links to web clients that will handle these references.

The idea here is that having these tags is that reader clients can display a list of backreferences at the bottom when one article mentions another.

The same principles can be applied to `nevent1...`, `note1...`, `nprofile1...` or `npub1...`.
