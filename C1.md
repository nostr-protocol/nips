Relay Features
--------------

`draft` `optional`

Upon connection, and at any point during the connection, the Relay can send a `FEATURES` payload to the Client reflecting the available commands to the client.

```json
["FEATURES", "<feature 1>", "<feature 2>", "<feature 3>", ...]
``` 

Where `feature` includes the following conventions:   

- `COUNT`, The relay will reply to [NIP-45](45.md) Count commands. 
- `NEG`, the relay supports Negentropy's `NEG-OPEN`, `NEG-MSG`, `NEG-ERR`, `NEG-CLOSE` commands

Clients should use the information to determine which Relay Client implementation they will use with each specific relay.
