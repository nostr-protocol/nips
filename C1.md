Relay Features
--------------

`draft` `optional`

Upon connection, and at any point during the connection, the Relay can send a `FEATURES` payload reflecting the available commands to the client and its user.

```json
["FEATURES", "<feature 1>", "<feature 2>", "<feature 3>", "..."]
``` 

Where each `feature` is one of the following labels:   

- `COUNT`, the relay supports [NIP-45](45.md) Count commands
- `NEG`, the relay supports Negentropy's `NEG-OPEN`, `NEG-MSG`, `NEG-ERR`, `NEG-CLOSE` commands

Clients SHOULD use the information to determine which Relay Client implementation they will use with each specific relay.
