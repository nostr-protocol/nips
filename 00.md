Editable Event
--------------

`draft` `optional`

An editable event is unique by a combination of its `.kind`, `.pubkey`,
and one or more specific tags.

Therefore, given two events with the same combination of such fields,
the one with the most recent `.created_at` is kept while the other is discarded.

If the timestamps are the same, the event with the lowest id (first in lexical order)
should be retained, and the other discarded.

## Editable by "d" tag

When a `d` (deduplication) tag is present, an event is editable by its `.kind`, `.pubkey` and the first `d` tag value.

The `d` tag is set as follows: `["d", "<string>"]`.

If always set to an empty string, the event in practice is treated as NIP-01 replaceable events, else as addressable.

This NIP simply expands NIP-01 addressable event usage to any event kind, no matter if outside the `30000 <= n < 40000` kind range.

These events are still referenced by NIP-01 `a` tags.

## Editable by "dd" Tag

When a `dd` (multiple deduplication) tag is present, an event is editable by its `.kind`, `.pubkey` and the first
occurrence of each tag listed on the `dd` tag value.

The `dd` tag is set as follows: `["dd", "<one-letter tag name list, order doesn't matter>"]`.

The tag list can't repeat letters. Each listed tag should appear only once as an event tag.

- Examples with a single `e` tag: `["dd", "e"]`
- Example with three tags: `["dd", "eap"]`.

Note: `d` tags take precedence over `dd` tags, but `d` and `dd` tags shouldn't be used together.

### Event with "dd" tag example:

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 99,
  "pubkey", "827ade3254c72ae811201b418766d9a8802e91b029d95cc9de2f0169274aedd7",
  "tags": [
    // relays and clients will check for other events with j tag = "12", z tag = "zz",
    // kind = 99 and same .pubkey, before choosing this event as the latest version
    ["dd", "jz"],
    ["j", "12"],
    ["c", "abc"],
    ["z", "zz"],
    ["status", "ok"]
  ],
  // ...other fields
}
```

### Referencing

An `u`(unique) tag is used for referencing the latest version of an editable event that has a `dd` tag. It has the following value format:
"`<event kind>:<event pubkey>:<tag name><tag value>`" or
"`<event kind>:<event pubkey>:<tag name><tag value><delimiter><tag name><tag value><delimiter>...`"

The delimiter between tag name/value pairs is the tilde ("\~"). If a tag value used on
a `u` tag contains a tilde, the "\~" char should be escaped with a preceding dash "-".

#### Referencing Example:

Referencing three editable (by `dd` tag) events:

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 100,
  "pubkey", "38cdb0e540bc08beb647c7d786c2a3efa9348f9dbbfa66b55959f150310ced1a",
  "tags": [
    ["u", "99:827ade3254c72ae811201b418766d9a8802e91b029d95cc9de2f0169274aedd7:j12~zzz"], // j tag = "12" and z tag = "zz"
    ["u", "102:827ade3254c72ae811201b418766d9a8802e91b029d95cc9de2f0169274aedd7:b908908098"], // b tag = "908908098"
    // example of escaping the ~ char
    ["u", "1009:0b8e7a1a4bdba24c911d10e9fc12417d420807488510dbd4fcd8b43e9a66ad74:c1-~3~d4-~6"] // c tag = "1~3" and d tag = "4~6"
  ],
  // ...other fields
}
```
