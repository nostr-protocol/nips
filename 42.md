NIP-42
======

Authentication of clients to relays
-----------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:Semisol` `author:fiatjaf`

This NIP defines a way for clients to authenticate to relays by signing an ephemeral event.

## Motivation

A relay may want to require clients to authenticate to access restricted resources. For example,

  - A relay may request payment or other forms of whitelisting to publish events -- this can na√Øvely be achieved by limiting publication
    to events signed by the whitelisted key, but with this NIP they may choose to accept any events as long as they are published from an
    authenticated user;
  - A relay may limit access to `kind: 4` DMs to only the parties involved in the chat exchange, and for that it may require authentication
    before clients can query for that kind.
  - A relay may limit subscriptions of any kind to paying users or users whitelisted through any other means, and require authentication.

## Definitions

This NIP defines a new message, `AUTH`, which relays can send when they support authentication and clients can send to relays when they want
to authenticate. When sent by relays, the message is of the following form:

```
["AUTH", <challenge-string>, <optional-client-request-id>]
```

And, when sent by clients, of the following form:

```
["AUTH", <signed-event-json>]
```

The signed event is an ephemeral event not meant to be published or queried, it must be of `kind: 22242` and it should have at least two tags,
one for the relay URL and one for the challenge string as received from the relay.
Relays MUST exclude `kind: 22242` events from being broadcasted to any client.
`created_at` should be the current time. Example:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "pubkey": "...",
  "created_at": 1669695536,
  "kind": 22242,
  "tags": [
    ["relay", "wss://relay.example.com/"],
    ["challenge", "challengestringhere"]
  ],
  "content": "",
  "sig": "..."
}
```

## Protocol flow

At specific moments the relay may send an `AUTH` message to the client containing a challenge, in one of the following forms:

- `["AUTH", <challenge-string>]`: No third array element. It means relay requires authentication for any resource access.
If applicable, it MUST be sent right after WebSocket `connection`.
Client may have already sent a message before receiving this one, in that case relay MUST also send an `AUTH` message in one of the other forms below;
- `["AUTH", <challenge-string>, "sub:<subscription_id>"]`: It references a previous client `REQ` message with a specific subscription id as third array element.
It means client subscription requested atleast one event that requires prior authentication to be accessed.
MUST be sent before the `EOSE` message with same subscription id. The relay SHOULD send no events before `EOSE` because the client is expected to retry the `REQ` after authentication;
- `["AUTH", <challenge-string>, "evt:<event_id>"]`: It references a previous client `EVENT` message with a specific event id as third array element.
It means relay requires authentication before publishing any or atleast this kind of event.
MUST be sent before `OK` message with same event id.

*Note: The challenge string is the same during the whole WebSocket connection. Multiple relay `AUTH` messages on the same connection
carry the same challenge string.*

After receiving a relay `AUTH` message the client may decide to
authenticate itself or not. The client may send an `AUTH` message right before performing an action for which it knows authentication will be required -- for example, right
before requesting `kind: 4` chat messages --, or it may do right on connection start or at some other moment it deems best. The authentication
is expected to last for the duration of the WebSocket connection.

Upon receiving a message from an unauthenticated user it can't fulfill without authentication, a relay may choose to notify the client. For
that it can use a `NOTICE` or `OK` message with a standard prefix `"restricted: "` that is readable both by humans and machines, for example:

```
["NOTICE", "restricted: we can't serve DMs to unauthenticated users, does your client implement NIP-42?"]
```

or it can return an `OK` message noting the reason an event was not written using the same prefix:

```
["OK", <event-id>, false, "restricted: we do not accept events from unauthenticated users, please sign up at https://example.com/"]
```

## Signed Event Verification

To verify `AUTH` messages, relays must ensure:

  - that the `kind` is `22242`;
  - that the event `created_at` is close (e.g. within ~10 minutes) of the current time;
  - that the `"challenge"` tag matches the challenge sent before;
  - that the `"relay"` tag matches the relay URL:
    - URL normalization techniques can be applied. For most cases just checking if the domain name is correct should be enough.
