Record Events
-------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines a way for users to keep editable records about other people and events.

## Pubkey Record

A pubkey record is a kind 30082 event where the `d` tag points to the pubkey of another user.

```js
{
  "kind": 30382,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<pubkey>"],
    ["n", "colleague"],
    ["summary", "This is my boss"],
    // other tags
  ],
  // other fields
}
```

Any tags can be used. Specific tag uses may be formalized in other NIPs.

The `content` field may be an empty string, or a NIP-44 encrypted tag list of private tags.

## Event Record

An event record is a kind 30083 event where the `d` tag points to the id of another event.

```js
{
  "kind": 30383,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<event-id>"],
    ["k", "1984"],
    ["p", "<event-pubkey>"],
    ["n", "open"],
    // other tags
  ],
  // other fields
}
```

This event MUST include the following tags:

- `k` - the kind of the referenced event.
- `p` - the pubkey of the referenced event (for outbox support).

Any other tags can also be used. Specific tag uses may be formalized in other NIPs.

The `content` field may be an empty string, or a NIP-44 encrypted tag list of private tags.
