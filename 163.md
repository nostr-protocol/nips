`Identicon Sentinel` visual profile hash sentinel for spotting spoofs
------------------------------------------

`draft` `optional`

Spoofing accounts on any platorm is faily easy using a profile picture, banner image and similiar NIP05.

`Identicon Sentinel` creates an identicon of an npub using https://github.com/laurentpayot/minidenticons, to sit alongside a profile image - to be used as a visual aid for users to easily spot spoof accounts.

Interopibilty is key by all using the same identicon library. https://github.com/laurentpayot/minidenticons is excellent, especially for smaller sentinel identicons. 

Minidenticons can be easily experimented with here, just pop in an npub https://laurentpayot.github.io/minidenticons

Using minidenticons Ben Arc's Identicon Sentinel in a nostr client would look something like this: <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TV7YAwc.png">
