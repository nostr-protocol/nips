Bookmarks
---------

`draft` `optional` `author:plantimals`

A bookmark is a stored event `ID`, allowing the user to keep track of events.

Bookmarks are indicated by `e` tags on a `kind 8` event containing the event
`ID` being bookmarked along with a note.

Bookmarks: `["e", "<event-id>", "<note text>"]`

A bookmark event MUST contain at least one `e` tag.

Example kind 8 event:
