Bookmarks & Pinned Events
---------

`draft` `optional` `author:plantimals`

A bookmark is a stored event `ID`, allowing the user to keep track of events
and indicate one of them as a pinned event.

Bookmarks are indicated by `e` tags on a `kind 8` event containing the event
`ID` being bookmarked along with a note.

A pinned event is indicated by placing that event `ID` alone in the `content`
field.

Bookmarks: `["e", "<event-id>", "<note text>"]`

Pinned Event: `"content": "<event-id>"`

A bookmark event MUST contain at least one `e` tag and MAY contain one pinned
event.

Example kind 8 event:
