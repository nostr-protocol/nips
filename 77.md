Localised Events
----------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines an event with `kind: -1` that can represent a non-public interaction with the relay that demands some sort of response from local IoT devices.

```json
{
    "kind": -1,
    "tags": [
        ["p", <iot-device-key>] // optional
    ],
    "content": {
        "event": "beer-dispensed",
        "amount": "500"
    }
    ...
}
```

These events MUST NOT be readable or writeable from devices outside the local network. If external access is desired, it is best implemented by a device operating on the local network or loopback interface. 

These events MAY be subject to a blacklist or whitelist of pubkeys. These events MAY be subject to external logic which determines whether the event will be successfully published to the relay.

## Example Uses

### Door Control

Define selective access to a space by associating membership with a keyfob (or potentially a NFC-enabled signing device) and requesting access by querying the local central relay.

### Jukebox

Post an event to the relay which will trigger a listening audio server to play a particular song, album, or playlist.

### Light Toggling

Send an event with a nostr application to change the color of smart lighting. Can be limited to one event every `x` seconds.
