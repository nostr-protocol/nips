NIP-57
======

Lightning Zaps
--------------

`draft` `optional` `author:jb55` `author:kieran`

This NIP defines a new note type called a lightning zap of kind `9735`. These represent paid lightning invoice receipts sent by a lightning node called the `zapper`. We also define another note type of kind `9734` which are `zap request` notes, which will be described in this document.

Having lightning receipts on nostr allows clients to display lightning payments from entities on the network. These can be used for fun or for spam deterrence.


## Definitions

`zapper` - the lightning node or service that sends zap notes (kind `9735`)

`zap request` - a note of kind `9734` created by the person zapping

`zap invoice` - the bolt11 invoice fetched from an HTTP endpoint which contains a `zap request` note


## Protocol flow

### Client side

1. Read the tag `"nip57"` fields from a user's `kind:0` (metadata) event, which are in the format `["nip57", "<url>", "<optional-hex-public-key>"]`

2. If that exists, display a lightning zap button on each post from that profile.

4. To generate a `zap invoice`, make a `POST` request to one of the `"nip57"` URLs with the body set to the `zap request` event as JSON, signed by the user's key. The `zap request` note contains an `"e"` tag of the note it is zapping, a `"p"` tag of the target user's pubkey, and an `"amount"` tag containing the stringified amount that is to be paid, in millisatoshis. The `"e"` tag is optional, not having it implies tipping the profile. The `zap request` note must also have a `relays` tag, which is gathered from the user's configured relays. The `content` MAY be an additional comment from the user which can be displayed when listing zaps on posts and profiles.

5. Pay this invoice or pass it to an app that can pay the invoice. Once it's paid, a `zap note` will be created by the `zapper`.

### Server (`zapper`) side

The server must have one or more handlers for NIP-57 calls that will come from Nostr clients. If it is handling payments for more than one user it can choose to discriminate the destination of the payments either by having a custom URL for each user or by looking at the `zap request`'s `"p"` tag.

Upon receiving a `GET` request on the NIP-57 handler, return a JSON object containing:

```json
{
  "pubkey": "<hex-encoded-32-byte-public-key-of-the-zapper-service>"
}
```

Upon receiving a `POST` request on the NIP-57 handler,

1. Parse the body as a `zap request` event and validate it:

	a. It MUST have a valid nostr signature
	b. It MUST have tags
	c. It MUST have 1 p-tag
	d. It MUST have either 0 or 1 e-tag

	e. There should be a `relays` tag with the relays to send the `zap` note to.

2. If valid, create an invoice in which the `description_hash` is the `id` of the `zap request` event.

At this point, the lightning node is ready to send the `zap` event once payment is received.

## The `zap` note

Zap notes are created by a lightning node reacting to paid invoices. Zap notes are only created when the invoice description (committed to the description hash) contains a `zap request` note.

Example zap note:

* The `zap` note MUST have a `bolt11` tag containing the bolt11 invoice.

* The `zap` note MUST contain a `request` tag which is the `zap request`.

* The id of the note inside `request` MUST match the description hash in the bolt11 invoice.

* The `zap` note MAY contain a `preimage` to match against the payment hash of the bolt11 invoice. This isn't really a payment proof, there is no real way to prove that the invoice is real or has been paid. You are trusting the author of the `zap` note for the legitimacy of the payment.

The `zap` note is not a proof of payment, all it proves is that some nostr user fetched an invoice. The existence of the `zap` note implies the invoice as paid, but it could be a lie given a rogue implementation.


### Creating a `zap` note

When receiving a payment, the following steps are executed:

1. Get the description for the invoice. This needs to be saved somewhere during the generation of the description hash invoice. It is saved automatically for you with CLN, which is the reference implementation used here.

2. Parse the bolt11 description as a JSON nostr note. You SHOULD check the signature of the parsed note to ensure that it is valid. This is the `zap request` note created by the entity who is zapping.

4. The note MUST have only one `p` tag

5. The note MUST have 0 or 1 `e` tag

6. Create a nostr note of kind `9735` that includes the `p` tag AND optional `e` tag. The content SHOULD be empty. The created_at date SHOULD be set to the invoice paid_at date for idempotency.

7. Send the note to the `relays` declared in the `zap request` note from the invoice description and to other relays of your choice.

A reference implementation for the zapper is here: [zapper][zapper]

## Client Behavior

Clients MAY fetch zap notes on posts and profiles:

`{"kinds": [9735], "#e": [...]}`

To authorize these notes, clients MUST use the public key from the `zapper` services of these and ensure that the zaps to their posts were created by that public key. If the public key is not on the users' `kind:0` profile, clients can fetch these public keys from the services themselves and ideally cache them. If clients don't do this, anyone could forge unauthorized zaps.

Once authorized, clients MAY tally zaps on posts, and list them on profiles. If the zap request note contains a non-empty `content`, it may display a zap comment. Generally clients should show users the `zap request` note, and use the `zap note` to show "zap authorized by ..." but this is optional.

## Future Work

Zaps can be extended to be more private by encrypting zap request notes to the target user, but for simplicity it has been left out of this initial draft.
