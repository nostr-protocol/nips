Resources
---------

`draft` `optional` `author:plantimals`

In order to allow events to transmit links to resources in a discoverable,
semantically accessible way, there should be a `kind` that provides a URL
and [media type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) to allow clients to handle the associated content. An initial
use case is in translating things like podcast feeds to nostr events. In that
context, the `resource` would map to the [RSS enclosure](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-profile#element-channel-item-enclosure), which is how
publishers indicate the URL to the audio content via RSS feed.

Exposing the `resource` at the level of a tag allows for subscription filters
to be added that return all events containing a certain media type. This
allows content aggregation by various means, from "re-sharing" `kind 9` events
that one encounters while browsing nostr feeds and later organizing those as
personal media feeds, to dedicated distribution of content similar to how RSS
feeds function for blogs, news, podcasts, etc.

There are several favorable dynamics of this system of distribution to
that of RSS.

`kind 9` allows:

* event-based distribution rather than polling a server
* on the fly map/reduce semantics around feed creation
* a broader distribution of the message content across many relays
* replies that provide clips of the associated media as people find them
* comments on the media to be syndicated along with the content itself

Implementation
--------------

A resource is a `kind 9` event with one `resource` tag referencing a URL and
its media type.

A resource tag looks like `["resource", "https://anchor.fm/s/45563e80/podcast/play/56797105/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2022-7-29%2F2cc29ddf-c44f-b38c-ee2c-88e0e1634449.mp3", "audio/mpeg"]`

The `content` field for `kind 9` MAY include text "about" the resource.

A `kind 9` event MAY include `e` tags referencing other events.
