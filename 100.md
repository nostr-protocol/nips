Using WebTransport Instead of WebSocket
---------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:kehiy`

# Abstract

The goal of this NIP is to adopt the [WebTransport](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/) protocol in place of WebSocket for nostr relays and clients.

# Motivation

`WebTransport` is a web API that utilizes the HTTP/3 protocol for bidirectional transport. Whereas `WebSockets` create a single stream per connection, `WebTransport` allows for the creation of multiple streams over one connection. Additionally, `WebTransport` employs [`QUIC`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) at its lower layers, which is faster and more secure than TCP. Moreover, `QUIC` includes `TLS` by default.

Considering these advantages, using `WebTransport` instead of `WebSocket` can render the nostr relay and clients faster, more secure, and more efficient.

# WebTransport Instead of WebSocket

Each relay MUST provide a WebTransport port and address, and every client MUST utilize WebTransport (given that JavaScript supports it). All other functionalities SHOULD remain the same, with the primary change being the replacement of WebSocket with WebTransport.
