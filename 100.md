Default Relay Port Standard
-----------------

`optional` `author:kehiy` `author:melvincarvalho`

This document standardizes the default network port for Nostr relays, each relay can serve it services on `4444` port as default.

# motivation

This standard can help developers for selecting a default port. also users know a `nostr://` url probably is on port `4444` and the relay nodes don't need to provide port by default when providing IP address.
