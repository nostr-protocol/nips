Private Key Mnemonic for Nostr
--------------

`draft` `optional` `author:kehiy`


## Abstract

This proposal suggests implementing private key mnemonics as an alternative authentication mechanism in the Nostr decentralized identity and authentication protocol. Private key mnemonics are easier to remember and provide an additional layer of security for user accounts and transactions.

## Motivation

By implementing private key mnemonics, we can provide an easier alternative for Nostr users to use and maintain private key directly.

## Proposed Implementation

We suggest incorporating private key mnemonics in the following ways:

User Authentication: Users MUST provide their private key mnemonic instead of the privatekey when logging in to their Nostr account.

## Conclusion

The proposed implementation of private key mnemonics for Nostr authentication would provide a more easier and convenient authentication mechanism for users.
