# NIP-100: NostrReAction - Unified Interactions for Likes, Shares, and Replies

## 1. Abstract

This NIP introduces `NostrReAction` (NostrRA), a new protocol designed to unify "like", "share", and "reply" interactions within the Nostr network. By consolidating these actions into a single event type, leveraging IPFS for larger content, and introducing a notification mechanism for content owners, `NostrReAction` aims to reduce network load, enhance content discoverability, simplify the user experience, and establish a validation chain for content.

## 2. Introduction

Current Nostr interactions like "like," "share," and "reply" often generate separate events, which leads to network redundancy and a fragmented user experience. `NostrReAction` addresses these issues by creating a unified event that acts as a single action record. This proposal emphasizes the importance of notifying content owners about content reuse and providing a mechanism to agree on content changes, establishing a chain of validation.

## 3. Goals

*   **Reduce Network Traffic:** Minimize the number of events by merging different interaction types.
*   **Enhance Content Discovery:** Improve content discoverability by aggregating interaction data and establishing a validation chain.
*   **Simplify User Experience:** Create a more cohesive and consistent interaction experience.
*   **Support Long Content:** Enable efficient handling of large content by leveraging IPFS CIDs.
*   **Preserve Content Integrity:** Ensure content integrity through the validation mechanism.
*   **Establish a Validation Chain:** Provide mechanisms to accumulate validations on identical content.
*   **Notify Content Owners:** Ensure content owners are informed about content reuse and modifications.

## 4. Specification

### 4.1. Event Kinds:

*   **`kind: 10037`**: `NostrReAction` (NostrRA) event.
*   **`kind: 10038`**: Notification event for NostrReAction.

### 4.2. Tags:

**For `kind: 10037` (NostrRA):**

*   **`["original_event_id", <event_id_source>]` (required)**: The ID of the original event being interacted with.
*   **`["original_author_info", <pubkey_source>, <relay_url_source>]` (required)**: The pubkey and relay URL where the original event was published.
*   **`["action_type", <action_type>]` (required)**: The type of interaction: `like`, `share`, `reply`, or `modify`.
*   **`["reply_to_event_id", <event_id_reply>]` (optional)**: The ID of the event being replied to, only if `action_type` is `reply`.
*   **`["ipfs_cid", <ipfs_cid>]` (optional)**: The IPFS CID for the content, if the `content` is larger than a certain limit.
*   **`["original_content_hash", <hash_content_original>]` (optional)**: The hash of the original `content`, used when `action_type` is `modify`.
*  **`["reply_text", <id_source>, <texte_reply>]` (optional)**: Text of the reply, used when `action_type` is `reply`

**For `kind: 10038` (Notification):**

*   **`["original_event_id", <event_id_source>]` (required)**: The ID of the original event.
*   **`["original_author_info", <pubkey_source>, <relay_url_source>]` (required)**: The pubkey and relay URL of the content owner.
*   **`["repost_event_id", <event_id_repost>]` (required)**: The ID of the NostrRA event causing the notification.
*    **`["modify_event_id", <event_id_modify>]` (optional)**: If the notification is about a content modification, the ID of the NostrRA proposing the modification.

### 4.3. Action Types (`<action_type>`)

*   **`like`**: Indicates a "like" action (no additional content).
*   **`share`**: Indicates a "share" action (no additional content).
*   **`reply`**: Indicates a "reply" action.
*   **`modify`**: Indicates a proposal to modify the original content.
 *  **`validate`**: Indicates that a proposed modification is validated.
 *  **`refuse`**: Indicates that a proposed modification is refused.

### 4.4. Content (`content`)

**For `kind: 10037` (NostrRA):**

*   If `action_type` is `like` or `share`, the `content` MAY be empty or contain a brief message.
*   If `action_type` is `reply`:
    *   If the reply is short, the `content` contains the text of the reply.
    *   If the reply is longer than 140 characters, the `content` contains `ipfs://<ipfs_cid>`.
*  If  `action_type` is `modify` :
     *   The `content` is the new `content` or `ipfs://<ipfs_cid>` if the new `content` is long.
**For `kind: 10038` (Notification):**

*   The `content` SHOULD be empty.

## 5. Workflow

1.  **Create a Reaction or Modification:**
    *   A user performs a "like," "share," or "reply" action on an event, or proposes a modification.
    *   An event of `kind: 10037` is created with the correct `action_type`, `tags`, and formatted `content`.
        *  When a modification is proposed, `original_content_hash` must contain a hash of the original content
    *   If the action is a  "like," "share" or "reply", an event of `kind: 10038` is also created to notify the content owner.
    * The NostrRA and the notification events are signed and published to the relays.
2.  **Receive NostrRA Event and Notification**
    *   Relays receive the `NostrRA` event and the `Notification` event.
    *   Clients following the original event receive the `NostrRA` event and clients following the content owner receive the `Notification` event.
3.  **Content Validation and Update:**
     * Content owners can decide to update content after reviewing incoming modifications or validate the chain.

## 7. Advantages

*   **Enhanced Content Ownership:** Content owners are notified of all interactions and changes related to their content.
*   **Content Validation:** Ensures a clear validation chain through notifications and explicit approval mechanisms.
*   **Improved Content Integrity:** The use of IPFS CIDs and hashes allows for validation that the content is identical.
*   **Robust Content Management:** Enables users to collaboratively build upon each other's content, while ensuring the content owner's control.
*   **Content ranking:** ranking is done based on the number of validation signatures on a content version.

## 8. Disadvantages

*   **Increased Complexity:** Implementing both `NostrRA` events and handling notifications might increase the complexity of clients.
*   **Additional Traffic:** The additional notification events might add to network traffic.

## 9. Considerations

*   **Client Implementation:** Clients MUST handle new `kind: 10037` and `kind: 10038` events.
*   **Relay Implementation:** Relays MUST accept and relay `kind: 10037` and `kind: 10038` events.
*   **Content Validation:** Clients should implement a robust method to validate content by analyzing the validation chain of events.

## 10. Conclusion

`NostrReAction` provides a new approach to handling common interactions in Nostr, ensuring content owners are informed of, and can participate in, the reuse and evolution of their content. This system should lead to more valuable interactions while preserving the core principles of Nostr by building a robust validation chain.
