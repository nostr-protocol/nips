# NIP-100: NostrReAction - Unified Interactions, Content Evolution, and Forking

## 1. Abstract

This NIP extends `NostrReAction` (NostrRA) to unify interactions, enable collaborative content evolution, and introduce explicit forking capabilities within the Nostr network. By consolidating "like," "share," "reply," and "modify" actions, introducing a new `fork` action, and leveraging IPFS for larger content, NIP-100 aims to reduce network load, enhance content discoverability, simplify the user experience, establish a clear, consensual, and evolutive chain for content management, and provide a method to deal with inactive authors by allowing content to be forked. The unified approach ensures that content owners are notified of all actions on their content, and that content with the greatest validation or a credible fork can be easily identified as the "main" or most "influential" version.

## 2. Introduction

Current Nostr interactions lack mechanisms for content forking and complex evolution. `NostrReAction` originally addressed the lack of unification for "like," "share," and "reply" actions, while also adding modification capabilities and a validation system. This new version of the protocol extends this further to add content forking and more sophisticated branching, with a system to resolve conflicts between different content versions. It will empower users with capabilities inspired by git to control and manage their content in a more meaningful way.

## 3. Goals

*   **Reduce Network Traffic:** Minimize the number of events by merging different interaction types into a single event.
*   **Enhance Content Discovery:** Improve content discoverability by aggregating interaction data, establishing a clear validation chain, and enabling easier forking of content.
*   **Simplify User Experience:** Create a more cohesive and consistent interaction experience, while providing a way to branch and fork content in an organized manner.
*   **Support Long Content:** Enable efficient handling of large content by leveraging IPFS CIDs.
*   **Preserve Content Integrity:** Ensure content integrity through a validation mechanism, allowing content to evolve while keeping a clear history.
*   **Establish a Validation Chain:** Provide mechanisms to accumulate validations on identical content based on a defined set of rules.
*   **Notify Content Owners:** Ensure content owners are informed of all actions on their content to maintain consistency.
*   **Content Evolution**: Content owners and other users can propose modifications on a content, and the author has a way to control the evolution.
*   **Content Forking**: Allow the community to fork a content if the original author is not available to manage the evolution of a specific content.
*   **Content Branching**: Support clients to represent the content evolution as a tree-like data structure.

### 4.3. Action Types (`<action_type>`)

*   **`like`**: Indicates a "like" action (no additional content).
*   **`share`**: Indicates a "share" action (no additional content).
*   **`reply`**: Indicates a "reply" action.
*   **`modify`**: Indicates a proposal to modify the original content.
*   **`validate`**: Indicates that a proposed modification is validated. This action **MUST** be signed by the original author of the content.
*   **`refuse`**: Indicates that a proposed modification is refused. This action **MUST** be signed by the original author of the content.
*   **`fork`**: Indicates a proposal to fork the original content into a new branch.

### 4.4. Content (`content`)

**For `kind: 10037` (NostrRA):**

*   If `action_type` is `like` or `share`, the `content` MAY be empty or contain a brief message.
*   If `action_type` is `reply`:
    *   If the reply is short (under 140 characters), the `content` contains the text of the reply.
    *   If the reply is longer than 140 characters, the `content` contains `ipfs://<cid_ipfs>`.
*   If `action_type` is `modify`:
    *   The `content` is the *new* `content` or `ipfs://<cid_ipfs>` if the *new* `content` is long.
*   If `action_type` is `fork`:
    *   The `content` is the *new* `content` of the fork, or `ipfs://<cid_ipfs>` if the *new* content of the fork is long.
 *  If `action_type` is `validate` or `refuse`, the `content` SHOULD be empty.

**For `kind: 10038` (Notification):**

*   The `content` SHOULD be empty.

## 5. Workflow

1.  **Create a Reaction, Modification or Fork:**
    *   A user performs a "like," "share," or "reply" action on an event, or proposes a modification, or a fork.
    *   An event of `kind: 10037` (`NostrRA`) is created with the correct `action_type`, `tags`, and formatted `content`.
        *   When a modification is proposed (including a reply), `original_content_hash` must contain a hash of the original `content`.
        *   When a fork is proposed, the `fork_from_event_id` must contain the `event_id` of the content being forked.
    *   An event of `kind: 10038` (Notification) is created to notify the content owner of this action.
    *   Both the `NostrRA` and the notification events are signed and published to the relays.

2.  **Receive `NostrRA` Event and Notification:**
    *   Relays receive the `NostrRA` event and the `Notification` event.
    *   Clients following the original event receive the `NostrRA` event, and clients following the content owner receive the `Notification` event.

3.  **Content Validation, Evolution, and Forking:**
    *   Content owners receive notifications of all interactions with their content. This allows content owners to keep a full history of all changes to their content, validations related, and forks.
    *   When a modification is proposed (action type = `modify` or `reply`), content owners can review and validate the change by:
        *   Creating a `NostrRA` event with type `validate` to approve a proposed modification, or type `refuse` to reject the modification.
        *   Once approved, the new version is considered the main version of that branch.
       *  If the modification is refused, the original content will be used, until a new modification has been proposed and validated.
     *   When a fork is proposed (action type = `fork`), content owners can chose to "accept" the fork as a new alternative branch, but the original branch is still considered as the main branch for the original content.
     *   The original author does not need to "validate" or "refuse" a fork, but clients can create a UI where the original author can easily "promote" a fork, and "demote" the original content.

4. **Content Selection and Branching:**
    *   An event is considered valid if and only if it has an associated `NostrRaAction` with `validate` and it must be from the original author, or a `fork` event.
    *   Clients can represent the content as a tree-like data structure, showing how the content has evolved over time, allowing the user to see all the branches.
    *   The validated event is the reference for the "main version" of the content in a specific branch, this can be used to sort a list by influence.
    *   Clients can choose to implement other algorithms to select the best version or branch if they need a different approach.
    *   Clients can filter the events to represent only specific branch of the content.
     *   Clients can resolve the `ipfs://<cid_ipfs>` using a public IPFS gateway.

#### 6.6. **Scenario: Alice's Original Content and Bob's Modification**

1.  **Alice Publishes Original Content:**
    *   Alice creates an event (let's assume a kind:1 text note) with the following details:

        ```json
        {
          "id": "original_content_id",
          "pubkey": "alice_pubkey",
          "created_at": 1678956780,
          "kind": 1,
          "tags": [],
          "content": "Hello, Nostr! This is my original thought.",
          "sig": "..."
        }
        ```

2.  **Bob Proposes a Modification:**
    *   Bob wants to modify Alice's original content. He creates a `NostrRA` event (kind: 10037) with `action_type: "modify"`:

        ```json
        {
          "id": "bob_modification_id",
          "pubkey": "bob_pubkey",
          "created_at": 1678956790,
          "kind": 10037,
          "tags": [
            ["original_event_id", "original_content_id"],
            ["original_author_info", "alice_pubkey", "wss://relay.example.com"],
            ["action_type", "modify"],
            ["original_content_hash", "hash_of_original_content"]
          ],
          "content": "Hello, Nostr! This is a modified thought by Bob.",
          "sig": "..."
        }
        ```
        *   **Note:**  The `original_content_hash` tag would contain the hash of Alice's original `content`. This helps ensure the modification is indeed based on Alice's intended content.

3.  **Bob's Notification Event:**
    *   Bob also publishes a notification event (kind: 10038) to inform Alice:

        ```json
        {
            "id": "bob_notification_id",
            "pubkey": "bob_pubkey",
            "created_at": 1678956791,
            "kind": 10038,
             "content": "",
            "tags": [
                ["original_event_id", "original_content_id"],
                ["original_author_info", "alice_pubkey", "wss://relay.example.com"],
                ["repost_event_id", "bob_modification_id"],
              ["modify_event_id", "bob_modification_id"]
             ],
            "sig": "..."
        }
        ```
         * **Note:** The tag `modify_event_id` helps the client to identify what was the original event to modify.

4. **Alice Receives Notification & Reviews Bob's Modification:**
    * Alice receives the notification event.
    *   Alice sees Bob's proposed modification and decides whether to `validate` or `refuse` it.

**Alice's "Validate" Action**

1.  **Alice Creates "Validate" `NostrRA` Event:**
    *   Alice reviews Bob's modification and decides to accept it. She creates a `NostrRA` event with `action_type: "validate"`:

        ```json
        {
          "id": "alice_validation_id",
          "pubkey": "alice_pubkey",
          "created_at": 1678956795,
          "kind": 10037,
          "tags": [
            ["original_event_id", "original_content_id"],
            ["original_author_info", "alice_pubkey", "wss://relay.example.com"],
            ["action_type", "validate"],
            ["validate", "bob_modification_id"]
          ],
          "content": "",
          "sig": "..."
        }
        ```
        *   **Key Point:**  The `validate` tag points to Bob's `bob_modification_id`.
        *   **Key Point:** The `pubkey` for this validation is from `alice_pubkey`.
2.   **No Additional Notification Event Needed:**
   *   In this case, Alice is just validating a previous modification, therefore no notification is needed.

**Alice's "Refuse" Action**

1.  **Alice Creates "Refuse" `NostrRA` Event:**
    *   Alice reviews Bob's modification and decides to reject it. She creates a `NostrRA` event with `action_type: "refuse"`:

        ```json
        {
          "id": "alice_refusal_id",
          "pubkey": "alice_pubkey",
          "created_at": 1678956795,
          "kind": 10037,
          "tags": [
            ["original_event_id", "original_content_id"],
            ["original_author_info", "alice_pubkey", "wss://relay.example.com"],
            ["action_type", "refuse"],
            ["refuse", "bob_modification_id"]
          ],
          "content": "",
          "sig": "..."
        }
        ```
        *   **Key Point:** The `refuse` tag points to Bob's `bob_modification_id`.
        *   **Key Point:** The `pubkey` for this refusal is from `alice_pubkey`.
2.  **No Additional Notification Event Needed**
   *   In this case, Alice is just refusing a previous modification, therefore no notification is needed.

**How Clients Handle These Events**

*   **Validation Tracking:** Clients track the validation chain. Bob's proposed modification (bob\_modification\_id) is only considered valid when a `NostrRA` event from Alice, with  `action_type: "validate"`, and with a tag `validate: bob_modification_id` exists.
    * If there is a `NostrRA` event from Alice with `action_type: "refuse"` and a tag  `refuse: bob_modification_id`, then the client will not consider the content.
*   **Content Display:** The client will display the original event from Alice, and if the bob's modification has been validated by Alice, then the client will display that event instead.
*  **Notification Handling** The client will display the notifications, grouping them by content source to show a user clearly what happens on its content.

**Key Takeaways**

*   **Explicit Actions:** The `validate` and `refuse` action types are very explicit and provide a clear signal of the content owner's decision regarding the proposed modification.
*   **Original Author Authority:** Only the original author's `pubkey` can create `NostrRA` events that `validate` or `refuse` a specific modification.
*   **Validation Chain:**  The tags maintain a linked chain of events, allowing clients to trace the evolution of the content.
*   **Consensual Process:**  By using this approach, the content will only be modified with explicit approval of the original author.

## 7. Advantages

*   **Unified Content Interaction:** Consolidates "like," "share," "reply," "modify", and "fork" actions into a single, manageable event type. This simplifies client implementations.
*   **Enhanced Content Ownership:** Content owners are notified of all interactions, modifications, validations, and forks related to their content.
*   **Clear Content Validation:** Ensures a clear validation chain through notifications and explicit approval mechanisms by the author and potentially other users.
*   **Improved Content Integrity:** The use of IPFS CIDs and hashes allows for verification that content is identical.
*   **Robust Content Management:** Enables users to collaboratively build upon each other's content, while ensuring the original author maintains control of the content evolution, but also allowing the community to fork if they feel the author is not managing the content in the proper way.
*   **Content Curation:** Allows users to rate and promote quality content, building curated feeds and collections.
*   **Content Ranking:** Ranking is done based on the number of validation signatures on a content version and its quality, and clients can implement their own way to rank different branch.
*   **Decentralized Storage** : The use of IPNS/IPFS allows to keep a permanent access to content
*   **Content Forking** : Enables community driven content curation and evolution.
*   **Content Branching** : Enables clients to represent the evolution and forks of a content in a tree-like view.
*    **Simplified Client Implementation:** NostrReAction simplifies client implementations by providing a single event type (`kind: 10037`) for multiple interaction types. This reduces complexity in handling different event kinds for likes, shares, and replies.
*   **Efficient Content Discovery:** By consolidating interactions into a single event type, NostrReAction enables more efficient content discovery algorithms. Clients can easily aggregate all interactions related to a piece of content, improving content ranking and recommendation systems.
*   **Scalable Content Modifications:** The protocol's support for content modifications with validation allows for collaborative content creation and curation. This is particularly useful for long-form content or community-driven knowledge bases.
*    **Reduced Network Overhead:** By combining multiple interaction types into a single event, NostrReAction potentially reduces the number of events transmitted and stored by relays, leading to improved network efficiency.
*   **Enhanced Content Integrity:** The use of content hashes and IPFS integration provides a robust mechanism for ensuring content integrity, especially for larger pieces of content or when dealing with modifications.
*   **Flexible Notification System:** The separate notification event (`kind: 10038`) allows for granular control over how content owners are informed about interactions with their content, without cluttering the main interaction events.
*   **Improved Analytics:** The unified event structure simplifies the process of analyzing content engagement, as all interactions are recorded in a consistent format.
*   **Future-Proof Design:** The protocol's extensible nature allows for easy addition of new action types or metadata in the future without breaking existing implementations.

## 8. Disadvantages

*   **Increased Complexity:** Implementing both `NostrRA` events, handling notifications and managing branches/forks might increase the complexity of clients.
*   **Additional Traffic:** The additional notification events might add to network traffic (relays can delete).
*   **Potential for Forks Overload:** If used in a bad way, this could create an overload of unorganized branches, and clients need to be very clever about how they implement the UI to avoid this.
*   **Validation Complexity:** Clients will have to manage a complex validation tree for each content, that could be resource intensive.

## 9. Comparison with Other Nostr NIPs

Here's how NIP-100 stacks up against some relevant existing NIPs:

*   **NIP-01 (Basic Protocol):** NIP-100 builds upon the foundational event structure defined in NIP-01. It introduces new `kind` values (10037 and 10038), tags, and content formats, but adheres to the core principles of event signing and relaying. It's not *competing* with NIP-01; it's an extension.
*   **NIP-02 (Contact List):** NIP-02 is about social connections. NIP-100 is orthogonal to this; it's focused on content interactions. The two can coexist, and contact lists can be used to inform which content to view or follow.
*   **NIP-10 (Event Deletion):** NIP-10 allows the deletion of events. While relevant to content management, NIP-10 and NIP-100 are separate concepts. NIP-100 provides a *validation* mechanism to build content evolution, while NIP-10 is about permanent deletion.
*   **NIP-15 (End-to-End Encryption):** NIP-15 is about privacy. NIP-100 focuses on content evolution and interaction management and is orthogonal to NIP-15, you can send encrypted content with NIP-100.
*   **NIP-23 (Long-form Content):** NIP-23 is about structuring and formatting long-form content. NIP-100 addresses the *interaction* with such content and it is related as it is using IPFS as well, it can be used in conjunction, but they are not in conflict.
*   **NIP-25 (Reactions):** NIP-25 introduced basic reactions ("likes"). NIP-100 *replaces* this with a more general interaction type, combining likes with other actions (share, reply, modify) and adding a notification system and a validation mechanism. NIP-100 offers a much richer feature set than NIP-25.
*   **NIP-47 (Wallet Interaction):** NIP-47 is about interaction with Lightning wallets. These are orthogonal and can co-exist. You could even use NIP-47 to pay for access to content that has been curated through NIP-100.
*   **NIP-50 (Content Search):** NIP-50 is about enabling content search by indexers. NIP-100 can be easily indexed using a "theme" tag for better discoverability.

**Key Benefits of NIP-100 (Compared to Current State and Existing NIPs):**

*   **Unified Interaction:** NIP-100 consolidates likes, shares, replies, modifications, and forks into a single event type, reducing network overhead, simplifying client-side development, and enhancing UX. This eliminates the current scattering of interaction events.
*   **Content Evolution & Ownership:** NIP-100 introduces a powerful mechanism for content evolution, allowing for structured co-creation and content refinement with the explicit consent of the original author. The content owner maintains control over modifications, ensuring a more collaborative and consensual process than simple replies, but allows for community forking if needed.
*   **Content Forking and Branching**: Allows to create new content branch and provides a way for clients to visualize them as a tree, giving a great understanding on how the content has evolved.
*   **Built-in Validation:** By requiring validations from the original author for modified content, NIP-100 establishes a clear validation chain, making it easier to determine which version of the content is considered "official" or of greater "influence". This significantly improves content integrity and trust compared to current methods, also clients can add other validations based on the number of users that have forked it or using other algorithms.
*   **Notification System:** The notifications to content owners about all actions taken on their content empower them to have full control over how their content is being shared, modified, and presented.
*   **Leveraging IPFS:** The use of IPFS enables the handling of larger content without overloading the Nostr network, addressing a significant limitation.
*   **Co-Signed Content:** the validation allows multiple users to co-sign on content as a community. This can bring powerful mechanism of content curation, content creation and content evolution.

**Strong, Evolutive Path Forward: Co-Signed Content and Beyond**

NIP-100 lays the groundwork for some very powerful evolutionary features, especially in the realm of co-signed content and community-driven content development:

1.  **Collaborative Content Creation:**
    *   **Multi-Author Modification:** Extend NIP-100 to allow multiple authors to propose modifications. The original author could then choose the "best" of several suggestions, or even accept multiple modifications.
    *   **Community Validation:** Introduce community-based validation rules. A content owner could delegate some of the validation power to certain pubkeys, establishing a "moderation team". They could also let the community vote on modifications using an algorithm like quadratic voting and then validate the result.
2.  **Content Forking and Versioning:**
    *   **Explicit Forking Mechanism:** A new `action_type` could be introduced called `fork`. This event can include a whole new version of the document. The original author can select what version is the canonical one for the initial event.
    *   **Content Branching:** Allow clients to visualize content as a tree, with each validated modification as a branch. Users could choose to follow one or several branches.
3.  **Beyond simple validation:**
    *   **Content Licensing :** Introduce licensing mechanism (e.g Creative Common) inside the tags, to formalize how a content can be used.
    *   **Content Provenance:** Integrate more mechanisms to track the origin and history of a content, allowing to trace back to the "root" event.
    *   **Reputation System:** Build on top of the validation mechanism and create a kind of "reputation" system, if an author is known to only provide value, we can give more trust to his content.
4.  **Content Curation:**
    *   **Curated Feeds:** Allow users to create curated feeds based on validated content, using tags.
    *   **Content Aggregation:** Introduce a specific kind of event that allows users to "aggregate" different content under a topic to create some kind of "magazine".
5.  **Monetization and Incentives:**
    *   **Content Revenue Sharing:** The validation mechanism can be used to build some kind of revenue sharing. If an author is providing a modification, he can ask a reward.

## 10. Considerations

*   **Client Implementation:** Clients MUST handle new `kind: 10037` and `kind: 10038` events. Clients need to be careful when implementing UI to deal with forks and branches in a organized and understandable way.
*   **Relay Implementation:** Relays MUST accept and relay `kind: 10037` and `kind: 10038` events.
*   **Content Validation:** Clients should implement a robust method to validate content by analyzing the validation chain of events.
*   **Forking Strategy** Clients must implement a logic to filter the forks, and select which ones are relevant for the user.

## 11. Conclusion

`NostrReAction` provides a new approach to handling common interactions in Nostr, ensuring content owners are informed of, and can participate in, the reuse and evolution of their content. This system should lead to more valuable interactions while preserving the core principles of Nostr by building a robust validation chain.

NIP-100 is a significant step towards a more robust, interactive, and collaborative Nostr network. It is not just a minor improvement; it solves major challenges in content management by adding features inspired by git. Its unified interaction model, combined with robust validation mechanisms, IPFS support, and the new forking and branching functionalities, paves the way for collaborative content creation and content management. It can be a big move toward a more community-driven internet. By implementing the suggested evolution, Nostr could become a much more powerful and dynamic platform for content sharing and innovation.

The key here is to see content not as static, but as a flow, an evolution, a life, and NIP-100 is designed for this type of paradigm. By adding explicit branching and forking, the management of this content evolution is easier to understand, and it empowers users to participate more actively in its development.
