NIP-100
======

Implementation of Bitcoin Token Interoperability Across Various DEXs
-----------------------------------

`draft` `optional`

The NIP defines the interoperability of Bitcoin Tokens, such as BRC20 tokens, among different DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges). DEXs utilizing this protocol enable the circulation of user order data among other DEXs using the same protocol, allowing for public display and cross-platform transactions. This enhances trading efficiency by increasing the exposure of user orders. The protocol was authored by the Orders.Exchange team.

## Info

A Seller or Buyer can publish these events:

| Kind |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 60018 | set_order | Create or update an order for product. |
| 60019 | take_order | Take a product and delete the order. |
| 5 | delete_order | Delete an order. |

**Event `60018`[:](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/15.md#event-30017-create-or-update-a-stall)  Create or update an order for product.**

**Event Content**:

```
{
    "platform": <String, the name of platform which order come from>,
    "orderId": <String, ID of order, SHA256(seller_address_inscriptionId_amount)>,
    "sellerAddress": <String, address of seller>,
    "productType": <String, product type: ordinal/brc20>,
    "orderType": <int, sell-1,buy-2>
    "publicKey": <String, public key from seller, for veritying sign>
    "sign": <String, sign data with private key>
    "data": {
      "inscriptionId": <String, id of inscription>,
      "coinAmount": <int, amount of tick sold>,
      "amount": <int, btc value>,
      "psbtRawCreate": <String, psbt raw which seller create>
      }
}
```

Fields that are not self-explanatory:

- `platform`:
    - The name of the platform that relay the order
    - eg: `"OrdersExchange"`
- `orderId`:
    - The ID of order,   `SHA256(<seller_address>_<inscriptionId>_<amount>)`
- `data`:
    - if `productType` is `ordinal`
        
        `data` Include fields：`inscriptionId/amount/psbtRawCreate`
        
    - if `productType` is `brc20`
        
        `data` Include fields：`inscriptionId/coinAmount/amount/psbtRawCreate`
        

**Event Tags**:

```
  "tags": [
       ["d", <String, ID of order],
       ["t", <String (optional), product category],
       ["n", <String (optional), tick name or ordinal name],
       ...
    ]
```

- the `d` tag is required, its value MUST be the same as the  `ordeId`.
- the `t` tag is as searchable tag, it represents different categories that the product can be part of (`ordinal`, `tick`). Multiple `t` tags can be present.

**Event `60019`[:](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/15.md#event-30017-create-or-update-a-stall)  Take a product and delete the order.**

| 2 | Seller | Update Order |

### Step 1: `seller` create an order (event)

Create an order event from Seller

`data` include:

- `inscriptionId` id of inscription
- `coinAmount` amount of tick sold
- `amount` btc value
- `psbtRawCreate` psbt raw from seller who created it

```
{
    "platform": <String, the name of platform which order come from>,
    "orderId": <String, ID of order, SHA256(seller_address_inscriptionId_amount)>,
    "sellerAddress": <String, address of seller>,
    "productType": <String, product type: ordinal/brc20>,
    "orderType": <int, sell-1,buy-2>
    "publicKey": <String, public key from seller, for veritying sign>
    "sign": <String, sign data with private key>
    "data": {
      "inscriptionId": <String, id of inscription>,
      "coinAmount": <int, amount of tick sold>,
      "amount": <int, btc value>,
      "psbtRawCreate": <String, psbt raw which seller create>
      }
}
```

### Step 2: `buyer` pay for order (event)

When buyer see orders and select one, then take it and make final psbt. Broadcast psbt tx at last.

`data` include:

- `inscriptionId` id of inscription
- `psbtRawCreate` psbt raw from seller who created it
- `psbtRawFinal` final psbt raw from buyer
- `txId` bitcoin txId

```
{
    "platform": <String, the name of platform which order come from>,
    "orderId": <String, ID of order, the same ID as the seller’s order which buyer would take>,
    "buyerAddress": <String, address of buyer>,
    "productType": <String, product type: ordinal/brc20>,
    "orderType": <int, sell-1,buy-2>
    "data": {

      "psbtRawCreate": <String, psbt raw which seller create>,
      "psbtRawFinal": <String, final psbt raw from buyer>,
      "txId": <String, txId from final psbt, which had been broadcasted>
      }
}
```

### Step other: `seller` Update Order or Delete Order (event)

Delete order by seller
```

    "orderId": <String, ID of order, the same ID as the seller’s own order>,
    "sellerAddress": <String, address of seller>,
    "publicKey": <String, public key from seller, for veritying sign>,
    "sign": <String, sign data with private key>,
    "data": {
      "inscriptionId": <String, id of inscription>
