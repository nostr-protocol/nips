Using WebTransport Instead of WebSocket
-------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:kehiy`

# Abstract

The goal of this NIP is to use [WebTransport](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/) protocol instead of webSocket in nostr relay and clients.

# Motivation

`WebTransport` is a web API that uses the HTTP/3 protocol as a bidirectional transport.
`WebSockets` creates a single stream per connection, `WebTransport` allows you to create multiple streams over a single connection, also `WebTransport` use [`QUIC`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) in lower layers which is more secure and faster than TCP (it's also have `TLS` by default).

By considering this two topic using `WebTransport` instead of `WebSocket` can make nostr relay and client more faster, secure and efficient. 

# WebTransport Instead of WebSocket

Each relay MUST provide a WebTransport port and address and each client MUST use WebTransport (javascript support it).
All of other SHOULD work like before and the only thing changes is WebSocket instead of WebTransport.
