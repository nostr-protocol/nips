Vanity npubs
------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines a canonical ambiguous extension for the Bech32 character set to allow for better user facing possibilities of vanity names within npubs.

* `1` is part of the Bech32 character set, used as a delimiter

Example
-------
`npub1mlke0...` could be displayed as `npub1Mike_...`. This will allow the npub owner to show proof of work for finding a 5 letter name. Additional trailing zeros (_) can be appended to increase the amount of work. This name can also be set as an optional field `vanity` on the JSON data of kind 0 events.

| 10     | 32<sup>10</sup> | 1_125_899_906_842_624
| 11     | 32<sup>11</sup> | 36_028_797_018_963_970
| 12     | 32<sup>12</sup> | 1_152_921_504_606_847_000

A nice feature of BIP32 HD wallets is the possibility to outsource the searching for vanity names by sharing an XPub derived on the path `m/44'/1237'/<account>'` without having to reveal the seed. 2_147_483_648 public keys can be derived per single XPub. And also 2_147_483_648 accounts / XPubs can be created from a single seed. That means on average one XPub will reveal any 6 letter name, and a single seed to contain any 12 letter name.

Example implementation
--------------
```Typescript
import { type Npub, isNpub } from "npm:nostr-types"

const txt = await Deno.readTextFile("path to characters .txt")
const lines = txt.split("\n")
const regexes: [RegExp, string][] = lines.map(line => {
  const [char, chars = ""] = line.split(" ")
  return [new RegExp(`[${ chars }]`, "g"), char]
})

export const vanityToNpub = (str: string) : Npub => {

  const bech32 = regexes.reduce((acc, cur) => {
    const [regex, char] = cur
    return acc.replace(regex, char)
  }, str.replace(/^npub1/, ""))
  const npub = `npub1${ bech32 }`

  if (isNpub(npub)) {
    return npub
  } else {
    throw new Error(`Could not create npub from string: ${ str }`)
  }
}
```
