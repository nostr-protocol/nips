Linked account
-------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines how to create the linked account. A linked account represents an account linked by another account owned by the same key-pair. It is not intended to function as a master-subkey system or a form of delegation. The relationship between the link source and desitination is expressed using `kind 0` events with a few tags.

## `kind 0` event

### Link source

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 0,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<link destination pubkey>", "<optional description>"],
  ],
  // ...
}
```

- The `p` tag contains a link destination pubkey. The optional description can be added.
  - It MAY have multiple `p` tags.


### Link destination

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 0,
  "tags": [
    ["P", "<link source pubkey as a proof>"],
  ],
  // ...
}
```

- The `P` tag contains the link source pubkey as a proof. If the proof is not contained, linking is invalid.
  - It MAY have multiple `P` tags.
