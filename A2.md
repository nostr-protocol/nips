Persona
-------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines how to create personae for a user. A persona represents an account owned by the main account but serving a distinct purpose. It is not intended to function as a master-subkey system or a form of delegation. The relationship between the main account and the persona account is expressed using `kind 0` events with a few tags.

## `kind 0` event

### Main Account

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 0,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<persona account pubkey>", "<optional description>"],
  ],
  // ...
}
```

- The `p` tag contains a persona account pubkey. The optional description can be added.
  - It MAY have multiple `p` tags.


### Persona Account

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 0,
  "tags": [
    ["P", "<main account pubkey>"],
  ],
  // ...
}
```

- The `P` tag contains the main account pubkey.
  - It MUST NOT have multiple `P` tags.
