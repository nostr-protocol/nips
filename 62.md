NIP-62
======

Right to Vanish
---------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP offers a Nostr-native way to request a complete reset of a key's fingerprint on the web. In some jurisdictions, this is a legally binding procedure and thus supporters of this NIP MUST trully delete events from their database. 

## Delete Account

Kind `62` informs a specific relay to delete everything, including [NIP-09](09.md) Deletion Events, from the `.pubkey` until its `.createdAt`

```js
{
  "kind": 62,
  "pubkey": <32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "tags": [
    ["relay", "<relay url>"]
  ],
  "content": "<reason or note>",
  //...other fields
}
```

The tag list MUST include at least one `relay` value. 

Content MAY include a reason or a legal notice to the relay operator. 

Relays MUST fully delete any events from the `.pubkey` if their service url is tagged in the event. 

Relays MAY store the deletion request for bookeeping and to make sure past events are not re-broadcasted into the relay. 

Paid relays or relays that have restrictions on who can post MUST also follow the request even if the key has not paid to get access to the relay. 

Kind `62` SHOULD only be sent to the target relays. 

## Right to Vanish

Kind `63` informs ALL relays to delete everything, including [NIP-09](09.md) Deletion Events, from the `.pubkey` until its `.createdAt`

```js
{
  "kind": 63,
  "pubkey": <32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "tags": [],
  "content": "<reason or note>",
  //...other fields
}
```

The tag list MUST be empty.

Content MAY include a reason or a legal notice to the relay operator. 

Relays MUST fully delete any events from the `.pubkey`. 

Relays MAY store the deletion request for bookeeping and to make sure past events are not re-broadcasted into the relay. 

Paid relays or relays that have restrictions on who can post MUST also follow the request even if the key has not paid to get access to the relay. 

Kind `63` SHOULD be widely broadcasted.
