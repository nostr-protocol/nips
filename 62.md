NIP-62
======

Curated Publication
----------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines the specification for curated publications - ordered, optionally-hierarchical assemblies of nostr events. Curated publications provide a standard way to organize and present related content, similar to how books organize chapters or journals organize articles.

## Event Kinds

This NIP defines two primary event kinds:

- `30040`: Publication Index
- `30041`: Publication Content

## kind 30040: Publication Index

A publication index defines the structure and metadata of a publication. It serves as a table of contents that references the actual content sections.

### Requirements

- The `content` field MUST be empty
- MUST include a `title` tag containing the full title of the publication
- MUST be uniquely identifiable by the combination of:
  - `d` tag
  - `pubkey`
  - `kind`
- MUST include `a` tags listing the events in desired display order.
  - Format: `["a", "<kind:pubkey:dtag>", "<relay hint>", "<event id>"]`
  - Optional event ID field enables version tracking while maintaining updateable references
  - Referenced events SHOULD be kind 30041 sections or nested kind 30040 indices
  - Additional event kinds MAY be supported
- MUST include an `auto-update` tag specifying update behavior:
  - Format: `["auto-update", "<yes|ask|no>"]`
  - Controls whether clients should automatically update to newer versions
- For derivative works:
  - MUST include: `E` tag referencing the original specific event, or an `A` tag referencing the updating article immediately after the `p` tag

### Example Index

```json
{
    "id": "<event_id>",
    "pubkey": "<event_originator_pubkey>",
    "created_at": 1725087283,
    "kind": 30040,
    "tags": [
        ["d", "aesop's-fables-by-aesop"],
        ["title", "Aesop's Fables"],
        ["author", "Aesop"],
        ["i", "isbn:9780765382030"],
        ["t", "fables"],
        ["t", "classical"],
        ["t", "literature"],
        ["published_on", "2003-05-13"],
        ["published_by", "public domain"],
        ["image", "https://imageserver.com/piclink.jpg"],
        ["summary", "Collection of selected fables from the ancient Greek philosopher, known as Aesop."],
        ["a", "<kind:pubkey:dtag>", "<relay hint>", "<event id>"],
        ["a", "<kind:pubkey:dtag>", "<relay hint>", "<event id>"],
        ["auto-update", "<yes|ask|no>"],
        ["<E, A>", "<original event id or address>", "<relay_url>", "<pubkey>"]
    ],
    "sig": "<event_signature>"
}
```

## 30041: Publication Content

Also known as sections, zettels, episodes, or chapters contain the actual content that makes up a publication.

### Requirements

- MUST include a `d` tag
- MUST include a `title` tag describing the section (e.g., "Introduction", "Chapter 1", etc.)
- The `content` field:
  - MUST contain text meant for display to the end user
  - MAY contain AsciiDoc markup
  - MAY contain wikilinks (denoted by double brackets)

### Example Section

```json
{
    "id": "<event_id>",
    "pubkey": "8ae74c618a4713f32129...",
    "created_at": 1708083476,
    "kind": 30041,
    "tags": [
        ["title", "The Farmer and The Snake"],
        ["d", "aesop's-fables-by-aesop-the-farmer-and-the-snake"],
        ["wikilink", "fable", "<pubkey>", "wss://thecitadel.nostr1.com", "<event id>"]
    ],
    "content": "== The Farmer and The Snake\nA [[fable]], by Aesop.\nONE WINTER a Farmer found a Snake stiff and frozen with cold. He had compassion on it, and taking it up, placed it in his bosom. The Snake was quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its natural instincts, bit its benefactor, inflicting on him a mortal wound. 'Oh,' cried the Farmer with his last breath, 'I am rightly served for pitying a scoundrel.'\nThe greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful.",
    "sig": "49cab8c75fb35cec71d07258..."
}
```
