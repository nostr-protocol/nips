NIP-114
=======

ids_only filter
---------------

### Description

When a filter has `ids_only: true`, the relay must return only the ids of the events that match the filter.

The ids are returned as `["HAVE", subscriptionID, eventID]` messages.

Clients may request the full events by id with a `["GET", eventId]` message. Relays reply to `GET` requests with `["EVENT", "*", eventJson]` messages, where `*` is a placeholder subscription id.

Clients may also request the full events by id with a normal `["REQ", subscriptionId, {ids}]` message.

### Motivation

`ids_only` filter allows a client to request the full event only when it is not already stored locally or received from another relay. This can save a lot of bandwidth, especially when connecting to multiple relays or subscribing to a lot of data.
