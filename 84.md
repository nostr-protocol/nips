Highlights
----------

`draft` `optional` `author:pablof7z`

This NIP defines `kind:9802`, a "highlight" event, to signal content a user finds valuable.

## Format
The `.content` of these events is the highlighted portion of the text.

`.content` might be empty for highlights of non-text based media (e.g. NIP-94 audio/video).

### References
Events SHOULD tag the source of the highlight, whether nostr-native or not.
`a` or `e` tags should be used for nostr events and `r` tags for URLs.

When tagging a URL, clients generating these events SHOULD do a best effort of cleaning the URL from trackers
or obvious non-useful information from the query string.

### Attribution
Clients MAY include one or more `p` tags, tagging the original authors of the material being highlighted; this is particularly
useful when highlighting non-nostr content for which the client might be able to get a nostr pubkey somehow
(e.g. prompting the user or reading a `<meta name="nostr:nprofile1..." />` tag on the document). A role MAY be included as the
last value of the tag.

```json
[ "p", "<pubkey-hex>", "<relay-url>", "author" ],
[ "p", "<pubkey-hex>", "<relay-url>", "author" ],
[ "p", "<pubkey-hex>", "<relay-url>", "editor" ],
```

### Context
Clients MAY include a `context` tag, useful when the highlight is a subset of a paragraph and displaying the
surrounding content might be beneficial to give context to the higlight.
