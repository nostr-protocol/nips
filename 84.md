Highlights
----------

`draft` `optional` `author:pablof7z`

This NIP defines `kind:9802`, a "highlight" event, to signal content a user finds valuable.

## Format
The `.content` of these events is the highlighted portion of the text.

`.content` might be empty for highlights of non-text based media (e.g. NIP-94 audio/video).

### References
Events SHOULD tag the source of the highlight, whether nostr-native or not.
`a` or `e` tags should be used for nostr events and `r` tags for URLs.

When tagging a URL, clients generating these events SHOULD do a best effort of cleaning the URL from trackers
or obvious non-useful information from the query string.

### Attribution
Clients MAY include one or more `p` tags, tagging the original authors of the material being highlighted; this is particularly
useful when highlighting non-nostr content for which the client might be able to get a nostr pubkey somehow
(e.g. prompting the user or reading a `<meta name="nostr:pubkey" />` tag on the document). A role MAY be included as the
last value of the tag.

```json
[ "p", "...", "author" ],
[ "p", "...", "author" ],
[ "p", "...", "editor" ],
```

### Context
Clients MAY include a `context` tag, useful when the highlight is a subset of a paragraph and displaying the
surrounding content might be beneficial to give context to the higlight.

### Ranges
Clients MAY include `range` tags with the start/end indexes of where the highlight begins and finishes within
the referenced article/tagged-event.

```
[ "range", <start-index>, <end-index> ]
```

Additionally a range with `context` as the third value of the tag MAY be added to indicate the begin/finish indexes
of the highlight within the included `context` tag.

```
[ "range", <start-index>, <end-index>, "context" ]
```

#### Text-based nostr events' highlights

Highlights of nostr-natives events SHOULD use the range index of the content as-is
(e.g. NIP-23 articles include the markdown instead of computing the index from the rendered markdown).

```
[ "range", 3000, 3042 ] # highlight begins at index position 3000 of the tagged event's `.content`
[ "range", 42, 84, "context" ] # highlight begins at index position 42 of the `context` tag's value
```

#### Non-text-based nostr events' highlights

A `kind:9802` event that tags a NIP-94 event which includes a video or audio file can use ranges to
indicate the start/end time position in seconds.

#### Ranges in URL highlights

When creating a highlight from a URL the range should be expressed over
the extracted plain text of the formatted content (e.g. rendered HTML instead of including the HTML markup);
this helps make finding the correct indexes easier on websites with markup variations on each render.

e.g. `<html><body>hello, world</body></html>`

Tagging `hello, world` would result in using a range tag like `["range", 0, 12 ]`.

Text extraction (i.e. translation from non-plain text medium like HTML or PDF) is highly subjective and the value
of the range should be carefully interpreted by the different clients that support this.
