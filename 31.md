Pinned Events
-------------

`draft` `optional` `author:plantimals`

NIP-31 amends the content metadata for `Kind 0` as described in [NIP-01](01.md).

Each pubkey MAY indicate a pinned event by setting the field `"pinned_event"`
in the json content of one's `Kind 0` metadata event to point to an
event `ID`.

Example json content from [this event](https://nostr.io/api/v1/events/71412d5cdb7e675b9806d23bda3d7c4878ca7f8e72ae3477c7179938e857cb9b):

```json
{
    "name":"plantimals",
    "picture":"https://plantimals.org/img/avatar.png","pinned_event":"c76166d9384355e8f55abfc071294fb815ac5f4050e2b9373b997b4bed66c669",
    "about":"[plantimals](https://plantimals.org)",
    "nip05":"_@plantimals.org"
}
```

The `pinned_event` field is meant to provide a link to additional content for
someone wishing to supplement their `about` text. Users SHOULD ONLY pin events
that they have authored in order to avoid mistaken identity.
