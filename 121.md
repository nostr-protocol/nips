Unicast event `"tags": "r"`
-------------------------------

`draft` `mandatory` `author:benarc` 

`route` list of relays as a new tag `"r"`, to help create a unicast route for an events.

```json
{
  "tags": [
    ["r", "<csv of relay IDs>"]
  ]
}
```

A client receives an event with tag `"r"`, if the client received the event from a relay in the list and it has a connection with the next relay in the list, the client will pass the event to that relay.
