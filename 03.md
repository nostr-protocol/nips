OpenTimestamps Attestations for Events
--------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:fiatjaf` `author:constant`

This NIP defines an event with `kind:1040` that can contain an [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org/) proof for any other event:

```json
{
  "kind": 1040
  "tags": [
    ["e", <relay-url>, <relay-url>],
    ["block", <block-height-as-string>, <block-hash>],
    ["alt", "opentimestamp attestation"]
  ],
  "content": <base64-encoded OTS file data>
}
```

- The `block` tag is optional, it exists to establish a minimum date since which the given event has existed.
- The `content` MUST be the full content of an `.ots` file containing at least one Bitcoin attestation.
- Ideally this file SHOULD contain a **single** Bitcoin attestation and no reference to "pending" attestations since they are useless in this context.
