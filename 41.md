NIP-41
======

Algorithm
------------------

`draft` `mendatory` `author:securitybrahh`

This NIP introduces a way for relays to be honest about how they are filtering the events when a client asks for them

`Relays` MUST advertize thier supported algo's name, name MUST be self-evident (and not a branding), description clear, and a `optional` formula is given if possible

## Querying

For each algorithm, the `relay` MUST allow `clients` to specify the algo as an `algo` query param on the connection URL string

`/r1`, `/r2` etc will be there in a type 2 i.e. aggregator relay

In other words, a `relay` whose regular URL is `wss://relay.url/r1` MUST also respond at `wss://relay.url/r1/asc` and `wss://relay.url/r1/seen_at`.

Upon replying to such requests, the supporting `relay` MUST sort the events according to their algo, `limit` accordimng to [NIP-01](01.md) shall be applied.

## Algorithm

The relay is at the libity to set any criteria for each of their algo GIVEN Name should be self-evident, description clear, and a `optional` formula is given if possible
