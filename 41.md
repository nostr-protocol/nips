Algorithm
------------------

`draft` `mendatory` `author:securitybrahh`

This NIP introduces a way for relays to be honest about how they are filtering the events when a client asks for them

`Relays` MUST advertize thier supported algo's name, its decription in plain english, name MUST be self-evident and not a branding

## Querying

For each algorithm, the `relay` MUST allow `clients` to specify the algo as an `algo` query param on the connection URL string.

In other words, a `relay` whose regular URL is `wss://relay.url/r1` MUST also respond at `wss://relay.url/r1/asc` and `wss://relay.url/r1/seen_at`.

Upon replying to such requests, the supporting `relay` MUST sort the events according to their algo, and if some events have equil weight in the order, they will be returned in **descending** order According to [NIP-01](01.md), filters with `limit` attribute are replied with events

## Algorithms

The relay is at the libity to set any criteria for each of their algo GIVEN the name is self-description, description is in clear language, and a `optional` formula is given if possible.
