# Ratings

This NIP defines a standard format for rating any entity within the Nostr ecosystemâ€”such as events, profiles, relays, hashtags, or even external content like books and movies. Ratings are recorded against a unique identifier (ID) and can be used to build reputation systems, recommendations, or filtering mechanisms.
## Definitions
- Rating: A numerical score from the user that reflects the perceived quality, usefulness, or relevance of an entity. This must be a normalized decimal (stored as a string) between 0 and 1, where 0 represents the lowest possible rating and 1 the highest.
- m (optional): A (m)ark tag indicating the type of entity being rated. Supported values include but are not limited to: event, profile, relay, hashtag, book, movie, etc.
- Content: The content of the review.

## Event Kind

A new event kind is introduced for submitting ratings:
Kind: 34259

## Event Structure

A rating is represented as a Nostr event with the following structure:

```json
{
  "kind": 34259,
  "content": "Optional comment about the rating.",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<target-id>"],
    ["m", "<entity-type>"],
    ["rating", "<float-between-0-and-1>"]
  ]
  ...
}
```
Required Tags

    ["d", "<target-id>"]: The unique identifier of the entity being rated. See ID Construction below for details.

    ["rating", "<float>"]: The rating value. Must be a number strictly between 0 and 1.

Optional

    ["m", "<entity-type>"]:  Describes what is being rated (e.g., event, profile, relay, etc.)

## ID Construction

To avoid ambiguity, especially when dealing with non-event entities like hashtags, a consistent namespacing format is required for the d (target ID) tag.
Namespaced Format

For non-event entities (or when IDs may conflict), prefix the ID with the entity type (the m value), separated by a colon:

`<entity-type:<id>`

| Entity Type | Raw ID                | `d` Tag Value                     |
|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| event       | c9dd213f...           | event:c9dd213f... or c9dd213f... |
| hashtag     | books                 | hashtag:books                     |
| relay       | wss://example.com     | relay:wss://example.com           |
| movie       | tt1375666 (IMDb ID)   | movie:tt1375666                   |

## Parsing Guidelines
The colon (:) after the type is mandatory for namespacing.
When parsing a d tag:
If a colon is present, the substring before the first colon is considered the type.
Everything after the first colon is treated as the identifier.
If no colon is found, assume the type is event.

Parsing Example (pseudocode)

```py
def parse_d_tag(d_tag_value):
    if ':' in d_tag_value:
        m, entity_id = d_tag_value.split(':', 1)
    else:
        m = 'event'
        entity_id = d_tag_value
    return m, entity_id
```
