On "e" and "p" tags in Text Events (kind 1).
--------------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:unclebobmartin`

## Abstract
This NIP describes how to use "e" and "p" tags in text events, especially those that are replies to other text events.  It helps clients thread the replies into a tree rooted at the original event.

## Positional "e" tags (DEPRECATED)
>This scheme is in common use; but should be considered deprecated.

`["e", <event-id>, <relay-url>]`  as per NIP-01.

Where:

 * `<event-id>` is the id of the event being referenced.
 * `<relay-url>` is the URL of a recommended relay associated with the reference.  Many clients treat this field as optional.
 
**The positions of the "e" tags within the event denote specific meanings as follows**:

 * No "e" tag: <br>
 This event is not a reply to, nor does it refer to, any other event.

 * One "e" tag: <br>
 `["e", <id>]`: The id of the event to which this event is a reply.

 * Two "e" tags:  `["e", <root-id>]`, `["e", <reply-id>]` <br>
 `<root-id>` is the id of the event at the root of the reply chain.  `<reply-id>` is the id of the article to which this event is a reply.  

 * Many "e" tags: `["e", <root-id>]` `["e", <mention-id>]`, ..., `["e", <reply-id>]`<br>
There may be any number of `<mention-ids>`.  These are the ids of events which may, or may not be in the reply chain.  
They are citings from this event.  `root-id` and `reply-id` are as above.

>This scheme is deprecated because it creates ambiguities that are difficult, or impossible to resolve when an event references another but is not a reply.

## Marked "e" tags (RECOMMENDED)
`["e", <event-id>, <relay-url>, <marker>]`  
	
Where:

 * `<event-id>` is the id of the event being referenced.
 * `<relay-url>` is the URL of a recommended relay associated with the reference.  It is NOT optional.
 * `<marker>` is optional and if present is one of `"reply"`, `"root"`, or `"mention"`

**The order of marked "e" tags is not relevant.**  Those marked with `"reply"` denote the id of the reply event being responded to.  Those marked with `"root"` denote the root id of the reply thread being responded to. For top level replies (those replying directly to the root event), only the `"root"` marker should be used. Those marked with `"mention"` denote a quoted or reposted event id.

A direct reply to the root of a thread should have a single marked "e" tag of type "root".

>This scheme is preferred because it allows events to mention others without confusing them with `<reply-id>` or `<root-id>`.  


## The "p" tag

### Unmarked "p" tags (DEPRECATED)
Used in a text event to record who is involved in a reply thread and mentions.
Any `p` tags from the event that is replied to, the public key of the event replied to, and the public keys mentioned are added to tags.

Example:  Given a text event authored by `a1` with "p" tags [`p1`, `p2`, `p3`] then the "p" tags of the reply should be [`a1`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`] 
in no particular order.

### Marked "p" tags (RECOMMENDED)

`["p", <pubkey>, <relay>, <type>]`


- `<pubkey>` is the public key being referenced.
- `<relay-url>` is the URL of a recommended relay associated with this public key. This is optional and may be an empty string.
- `<type>` is required. It can be:
    - `reply`: This public key is involved in the reply thread.
    - `mention`: This public key is mentioned in this note or was in the reply thread.
    - `silent`: This public key is being referenced in this note but should not be notified (such as public key lists).
    - A blank string.

A client should follow the following steps while creating a note.
A `p` tag should not be added if one with the same type and pubkey exists in the tag list.

1. Copy any `p` tags from the event being replied to, if any, except ones with the type `silent`.
    - If there are p tags without a type string (blank strings are fine), they should be copied over with a `type` of `reply` and a relay may be optionally set if the client has that information.
2. Add a `p` tag with the pubkey of the event being replied to, if any, with the type `reply`.
3. Add any `p` tags that are mentioned with the types `mention` or `silent` depending on if the user wants to silently mention someone.

Clients SHOULD NOT show notifications from events with `p` tags mentioning this user with the type `silent`.
